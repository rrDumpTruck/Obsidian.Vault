(Excerpt removed from "Working Title, a Personal Journal") 
Previously I mentioned that I viewed a couple of different periodical Epochs preceding or being caused by large events in my life. I hope to outline these epochs of experience so that I may glean information on how I developed into the person that I am today. Additionally it may lead to a deeper understanding of who I am, and help me remember that I am a good person.


**Innocent and Intangible (1997-2005)**

From birth until I was about 8 years old I have very little memory, I know that it was largely a non-traumatizing part of my life due to me being fairly fortunate when it comes to having a comfortable and enriching home life at that age. Things that I think helped me grow in this period of time were:

Mom and Dad encouraged me to be curious, in this stage it was largely reading and watching television. They fostered a highly literate and mature mindset in me from early on. So much so that most adults were surprised I was as young as I was at this age.

  

**Naïve and Curious (2005-2010)**

Just after I started at Salisbury Elementary I feel that I had my "Awakening"... meaning when I started making decisions for myself, solving my own problems and most importantly I realized what my strengths and weaknesses were. The first few years (Kindergarten, 1st and most of 2nd grade) went with out event, I was slow to wake but once the fire was lit I started seeing things very differently, I used my size and intellectual superiority over my peers in detriment to my own life. I suffered from severe anger issues, disrespect for authority and was altogether an annoying little shit to anyone I didn't feel respected me, including teachers, fellow students, my principle and vice principle. In the end the thing that pulled me out of it happened in about 4th grade I think.

Due to my anger issues and disrespect for authority I had in school suspension a fair few amount of times for one reason or another. The last time I recall having it was when I got into a fight with another student, sticking up for myself and my friend after being called "the fat kids" during art class. I very nearly killed a student when I was walking past the person who insulted me he was leaning back in his chair... I grabbed the back of his chair as I was passing his desk and slammed it backwards towards the floor. He got sent home early for medical reasons and I felt genuinely bad after the fact.

During the suspension I met a boy who was very old for a 5th grader, I asked him multiple times if he was on a middle school trip as often happened the middle school kids would visit the elementary and read to the littler kids. I never saw this kid before or after but I remember the conversations we had that day. He was in 5th grade for the third time through, he seemed way too smart to actually require being held back that many times. He reminded me of myself, but I had a few years to correct these series of mistakes. He told me of how often he was in the suspension room, stating that he was in here more than any room in the building. I think what caused this to be an important moment in this part of my life was this was the first time I saw somebody his age acting like me, a person a few years younger than him. I believe this woke me up to the very real fact that I am in control of what happens to me, my failure is my own and is only caused by my lack of effort or emotional immaturity in the way that I dealt with negative emotions.

All through this era my father started to introduce firearms and hunting into my life. While I didn't hunt with him until I was around 11, I shot guns with him at the shooting range (New Holland Rod & Gun Club) nearly every week. I so looked forward to these outings that it felt like Christmas whenever Dad would come into my room on Sunday mornings and ask me to get up for breakfast and to go the range. Writing this now I realize it was his way of bonding with me after he was absent for a large part of my childhood on business in Maryland and Virginia for his fathers company. He took me through my understanding of the way we interact with nature, why we live the way we do and how to value the things we don't usually think about such as wildlife, firearm responsibility and the procedure of how to  approach entirely new things.

Once while hunting whitetail deer at "Old Man Wilson's farm" in Narvon my father let hold and shoot a high caliber rifle for the first time, a bolt action .308. We were walking back to our vehicle when I got pouty about not seeing anything to shoot while we were hunting, I believe it was the second day this happened that week. He saw me become upset and offered to let me shoot, warning me of the kick that this gun had compared to others that I had shot up to then. I didn't shoulder the rifle properly and it slipped off of my shoulder from the recoil, the scope hit my eye and left a funny looking ring shaped bruise. I was proud to show it off in school the following day.

My father taught me how to be proud of myself during this part of my life, making good shots with firearms, being rewarded for seeing things noone else sees and thinking before I act. I have a feeling that the introduction of sports and hunting in my life was the outlet that I required for my behavior to improve in and out of school. Mom supported his habits and appreciated (at least I think so) the much needed breaks that she got from being a full time mother.

After a lot of practice with hunting my dad finally bought me my own high caliber rifle, a 7mm-08 Browning A-Bolt. One of the first few times we went to the range to sight it in I was taking long shots (300 yards) and after the second shot I hit a golf ball that he jokingly put on a post near the backboard. He looked at me in a way I hadn't really experienced before, I now know this was most likely pride (I hope). He kept the golf ball in the gun cabinet and showed it off to his friends at work when it happened, I still have it and protect it because I see it as one of the first times my father was that proud of me.

My dad attempted putting me into sports and I enjoyed them for the most part. I joined a football team that had players almost 4 years older than me due to my weight disqualifying me from joining the teams that were my age group. The practices showed me my shortcomings in the cardio and determination department, probably becoming one of the first times I actually failed at something I tried to succeed in. The nail in the coffin for playing football was when I missed three consecutive weigh ins, the last only being over by a pound and a half. Even then they still didn't play me very much in the games that I was able to join. Eventually I got tired of being a benchwarmer and being berated by a coach that ended up leaving the district after that year, I joined baseball/basketball leagues associated with my school district.

Basketball was started at my request, the practices went well and I got along with most of the people on my team and my coaches. Most of the people in the team I ended up going to school with and being well liked by them, but ultimately it wasn't really the sport for me.

Baseball was something that I really enjoyed for a long time. I played from about 2004 all the way until I started high school. The first team I was on was tee ball, where I met one of my best friends Nick Detore, his grandpa and father were assistant coaches for the team. I played one or two years of normal league baseball and eventually due to my heavy hitting I tried out for a travel league. The travel league was where I met a lot of my friends/acquaintances that lasted me throughout my high school days. I played as catcher, and pinch hitter for the team, some left outfield later on in the season. Eventually my coach approached me and my parents, stating that the reason a lot of my teammates were on this team was so that they could join the high school team and maybe play for a college team eventually. This we later discovered was his way of saying "we are going to play you a lot less" because talent scouts for the high school team began watching the games. I hurt my Achilles tendon on my left foot shortly after this while running around bases following a homerun that I hit and it still hurts every now and then. I hold few hard feelings from this era, mainly the cliques of kids who planned on going into the high school teams. Danny Rosado was a good friend of mine throughout most of middle school, when we were celebrating our last games at a local ice cream stand he called me "fat-ass" in front of everyone for almost no reason and claimed he was glad I didn't get to play much because I sucked... this was objectively false as I had more RBI's than 90% of the team, so we grew apart... everyone makes mistakes, maybe I should reach out.

One of the first times I remember experiencing a forlorn feeling of the past is one day when we were living at our house on Wertztown Rd.. I had a habit during the summer of going outside and just hitting the ball around the yard, chasing after it time and time. One time I hit the ball so far it went deep into the woods and I couldn't find it after an hour of looking. This happened the summer after I graduated middle school I think, and after the travel league ended. I sat on the steps of the back porch and cried long and hard. I didn't know why, but now I know that I was grieving over the loss of my team. Looking back I know it was fine for me to feel this way, but I felt like a baby for it, so I hid my love for baseball and eventually grew out of it and my love for it turned into a love of reading, video games and playing the drums.


**Morbid Inquisition (2010-2017) aka. "Past Me"**

This particular period in my life is probably the most painful to talk about. It will probably end up being the longest of the "Epoch"s of my life as it housed the largest amount of catalytic moments of my life.


**My Full Understanding of Talent** 
In seventh or eighth grade I was taken on a trip with my parents to the beach (Ocean City, Maryland). On this trip I was brought to a music night a biker bar, at the time it was legal as long as it was an "open air" establishment. There was a drummer there that played songs that I enjoyed quite a lot and I watched him play for nearly 4 hours that night. Doing amazing solo's and even keeping perfect time so far as I could tell. I approached him with my father and told him that he was awesome and sounded great. My father spoke up after me and told him that I was an aspiring drummer. The look in my fathers eyes as he said it was that of pure pride and excitement. 

On the ride home I kept telling my parents I was going to be like him (the drummer). (During this ride, mom was quite drunk) both applauded my aspiration and mom even cried saying how proud she was and some other praise I don't quite remember. Later that year they bought my PDPx7 drum set and I began a great journey in my life. At first I probably sounded like a trash can being thrown down staircase, but in time I learned discipline and skill are very intermixed. I put as much thought into drumming as I did into video games (not a lot). It wasn't very long until I was playing along to my favorite metal songs and my parents were actually able to recognize the beat. There is a video of my early playing (It's quite bad) that was filmed by my dad and his voice is clearly audible. I have gone back and watched this video and a few other home videos so many times I've lost count, I now have it backed up in numerous places so I never lose it because to me he is still watching me each time I play. 

I realized too late how much my dad expected of me. To me the true beauty of musical talent is that it lies bare the soul of the player if played well. Even a "noisy" instrument like a drum-set can show your passions and love for music. I was only in a band for a short time in high school, and a fractional upstart after high school. This is one of my only regrets; I wish I would have tried harder to pursue drums as a career possibility or even as a professional interest. Its obviously not too late, considering how my playing has improved in even just the last year(2024). 

  

**What it Means to be Creative**

  

**The Death of My Father**

Richard Lee Heist, Jr., 52, of Paradise, died on Monday, September 23, 2013 as a result of an truck accident near Roanoke, VA. He was the beloved husband of Judy A. Hollinger Heist with whom he shared 20 years of marriage. Born in  Somerset, PA, he was the son of Richard Lee Heist Sr. of Somerset and the late Dolores Weimer Heist. 

Richard was employed by Schumaker Trucking.

He is survived, in addition to his wife and father, by one son Richard M. Heist at home, one stepdaughter; Amanda Daily of Narvon, three step grandchildren and two sisters Tammy Higgins of Alexandria, VA and Nancy Heist of Woodbridge, VA. He was preceded in death by  one brother Michael Heist and one stepdaughter Heather Daily.

The day before he left I helped him write and print multiple copies of a "trip sheet". He always had trouble with formatting in google docs and similar word processors, but I had no issue with helping him and did so excitedly. The documents can be found on [rmh6055@gmail.com](mailto:rmh6055@gmail.com) 's google drive account... being that the format still exists when you are reading this (hopefully).
  
I wrote the below obituary two days after my fathers passing. It took me a very long time to realize who my father actually was. Like everyone else, he wasn't perfect... he made mistakes but to me he was a hero.

"There are many things that you do not wish to do in this life and one of them is having to lose someone that you love. He was my dad and I was not expecting this. This week has been the beginning of a change that will take the rest of my life. I will never forget you, I will just keep your memories beside along the journey. I will never forget the memories that I have made with you. Weather it be; Hunting, Riding motorcycles, and spending time with you. And I dread not being able to make more. All that I have to say is I love you and I will miss you. "

Above is an exact transcript of the prepared speech that I had leading up to the day of the funeral. I will list below what I remember saying, based on the fact that I was too emotional to read the speech verbatim I spoke from the heart and delivered a very personal speech. I was told afterwards that the words I said would touch their hearts "forever" and I hope they were telling the truth because it may be the most true statement I have said.

"There are many things that you don't wish to have happen to you in this life, for me it was losing someone so close to you... He was my dad, and I wasn't expecting this. This week has been the beginning of a change that will take the rest of my life. I will never forget you, I will just keep the memories alongside the journey. I will never forget the memories that I have made with you. Weather it be hunting, riding motorcycles or spending time with you... I dread not being able to make more. All that I have to say is that this moment is like a blade being forged, this being the quenching bath after leaving the furnace of grief that this event has and will continue to be... All that I have to say is that I love you, and I will miss you. "

Below for reasons of posterity, are the tracks I prepared with my mother and sister for my fathers funeral "soundtrack" (In order)

I underestimated just how difficult this was to record/write. I always knew it was a very difficult part of my life but I wasn't sure how detached I was from the events following. I was 16 years old when my father died. Ironically the same songs play quite often at weddings, family reunions and even at celebrations. It reminds me every step of the way, certain bands (namely CCR, Metallica, and Journey I keep on current playlists to this day). I hope he is up there listening, and that my listening to it brings me closer to him, it does in my heart at least. The last song I have accurate memory of listening to in his memory is Chicken Fried, as corny as it may be... it holds a special meaning to me and probably always will. I love you Dad.

I miss my father so fucking much that it hurts me physically to say it out loud, I am very glad I don't have to speak to record words here because I don't think I ever could otherwise. My father is an unending font of lessons, even if he didn't teach them to me himself I have found the capability to learn them postpartum, for better or for worse. Even today (07/23/23) I was literally incapable of exclaiming to my friends just how much I missed my father.

I may not be prepared to write this section of my life but I will try anyway, regardless of consequence. In chronological order...

Coming out of 2010 and until 2013 I was acclimating and adjusting to high school culture, It was much different than middle school, surely. The main differences were that the students received more leeway in the process of completing a task, for the better in most cases. On the few occasions that interactions with underclassmen happened it was usually an equal and happy experience... usually the environment led to the upperclassmen being much more stressed and tied down than the underclassmen meaning I was pretty much alone with the people of my graduating year.

I was performing under expectations, not focusing on the correct things for someone whos main job is being in school. I completed the minimum effort to not be failing any classes, and in classes that I cared about I tried my hardest: namely history, math and English. Now I realize what I was lacking was investment in the work I was producing. So much of my sense of failure can be attributed to a lack of understanding of what I should be understanding as important work. Everything I have witnessed leads me to believe that public school has that effect on people... and eventually my father died.

I was coming home from school on a Monday afternoon, wheeling the trash can in from the Sunday trash pickup, when I realized that my entire extended family was on my front porch. I immediately asked what was wrong, intuitively knowing that this doesn't usually happen. The first person I remember seeing was my sister, who led me to my mother and we all collectively convulsed and sobbed together... lamenting the unfortified death of the only man I had looked up to in my life. Turns out... my father had died the night before I went to school, and "people" thought it would be a good idea to wait until I went home to tell me. I don't remember my classes, barely what grade I was in... but what I do remember is the cries of my mother and myself. Like wounded animals we lamented the loss, crying without thought, feeling without thinking the grief poured over all of us like a waterfall on a speck of dust. I cannot find one person who was there that remembers what happened exactly during this event, I believe we all blocked it from our memory... we found it so traumatizing. But I remember,  it was an extremely extended period of  existential anguish. Nothing more. The pain radiates like Chernobyl, the memory still as real as the day all of it happened, yet still I can't find a single account that remembers the same events that I do.

The first memory I have after this is multiple days after. I sprang into action, determining myself as the most valid candidate to form my fathers obituary and funeral playlist. I have recorded the obit/playlist above before the recollection of the day of death. The process was therapeutic for me at the time. I think it was because it turned out to be the only thing I had control of during that time, though I believe that I probably shouldn't have been put on my shoulders as squarely as it was. I feel I did a stupendous job for a sophomore in high school, and would gladly write the same speech again, if in exclusion of the minor spelling and typos... but that is forgiven due to the circumstance.

I was slow to rejoin my friends at school, thinking at every moment in the back of my mind that Dad wasn't there to watch so "what was the point". This was entirely my fault, Dad has been watching me from the day that he left this world. A part of me at this point, and a smaller part still wonders if he left accidentally as the reports say. So many of the conversations between me and my mother regarding Dad usually end in her exclaiming that "Paul Barthel" killed him while negotiating a new business they were planning on starting. I think this is unlikely, but only due to Occam's razor and no concrete evidence like I would prefer. Sometimes when I am drunk I claim to be on a vengeance path to "Paul", but honestly I doubt I will ever consider following that avenue to its end. If I am wrong I am sure that Dad will give me a sign otherwise.

A friend I made during my late freshman and late sophomore year named John Simmers showed great support during a time of great need for me. He showed up to the funeral, played games with me while I was grieving and even encouraged me to find bigger and better things once he moved on from school (he was one year ahead of me in school). (I tried reaching out recently, he said that he is into fishing but has 3 kids so finding the time is difficult lol).  We lost touch for a while after he graduated, trying to start a band later but that idea fell apart for reasons beyond our control.

A year after John went into vocational school during my junior year I found myself without friends. I gravitated towards people I knew already (Zach Martin, Nick Detore, Steven Boepel, and a few others not worth mentioning primarily. I have since realized this group of friends to be my actual friend group from my freshman year and beyond, I ignored them due to a misunderstanding in a videogame from my freshman year, possibly before that even. I was lost... and eventually I found a purpose, a friend (Nick Detore) recommended I join "Chamber Singers" or concert choir to start. I was lucky, I tried out for concert choir and the teacher who I was auditioning for (Nathan Bankert) granted me a spot almost immediately, even going as far as recommending I join Chamber Singers. That was it, I was in... the first choir experience was one of the weirdest things I have experienced... a feeling of belonging and yet still foreign like a language you do not yet speak. I remember my mothers reaction when I told her I changed my schedule to include concert choir, and eventually chamber singers. I can't really remember a time where she was a happy for me as then, and I can understand why. Personally I believe this was one of the most important moments in my life. I could have chosen to sit back, take what comes to me and apply myself to a course of study that isn't requiring of my creative skills like math or physics. Instead I was led down a road of perpetual growth and replenishment of my will to live... I cannot think of anything to say except thank you Nick. I may have just become another statistic, or even worse... "you" have no idea what my mind was like during this time, and the fact that you recommended this and were there for me throughout means the universe to me... I am still searching for ways to repay you.

Shortly after my involvement in Chamber Singers started I began my interest in Musical, initially believing I would get a chorus part but being encouraged (by Mr. Bankert) to join as a lead role. I prepared it, sang it time and again... then eventually I got it, the role of Ubaldo Piangi in my local High School production of Phantom of the Opera. Rehearsals taught me a lot about accountability and responsibility. Eventually we made it to the production dates... believe it or not my grandpa came, along with both of my aunts on my Dad's side. It felt so bittersweet, all my life my grandpa and Dad had a difficult relationship... he was happy to see me but I feel it was in spite of my father's relationship to it all... but all I cared about during opening night was the opinion of my mother and aunt. I killed it, I was told I sang so loud during my part that they could hear me from the parking lot... not surprising considering how loud I am as a singer, especially when trying to reach higher notes.

I rode very highly on the aftershock of this event. My grades in my senior year were affected, people considered me "healed" but I was not in fact... not even fucking close. I edged closer to accepting my lot in life before ultimately "coming to reality" in the second quarter of my senior year, when I came to the conclusion that my mother was unable to continue on by herself long enough for me to pursue a college career. I had secured a nearly full ride at a liberal arts school for a computer science degree at Cabrini University in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. This fact and the fact that I was terrified of what came after high school led to me ultimately shutting down my response to deadlines due to the overwhelming feeling of an impossible decision. 

During my senior year I was in the Musical program, and that year they decided to perform Into The Woods, a Disney musical about the amalgamation of a slew of fairy tale characters for a "modern audience". Quite a good musical on paper, I was nonplussed when I received the role of the narrator and "old man" who played a minor role as the father to the main character "the baker". I think this is where my feeling of inequity started, but it's as likely as not. In the tail end of that school year my school decided out of the blue to implement a program where if you had a C in any class you could no longer attend after school functions (this excluded sports for some fucking reason), since I got a D+ on a singular test in my Honors Calculus class because I was sick during the time it's contents were taught, that meant I was unable to attend musical practice until the grade was higher. The teacher I had for the class I was failing at that time had told me when I visited him after being told I shouldn't be in musical practice (due to my grades) told me he wouldn't update them, even after I finished a re-test with a B+ until next Monday (7 days from that point). 

What followed was my attempt at equality seeking behavior. I went to musical practice when I knew I shouldn't be there. This worked for a few days, but failed inevitably when the vice principle noticed my attendance. I made an attempt to explain how I had retested and passed... and how it was the last few practices before the dress rehearsal that was to start literally three days from that point. It fell on deaf ears, as if I was trying to explain myself with lies, when if the VP would have even tried to check with my math teacher they would have seen the test was already graded and just hadn't been updated in the system. She explained to me that since this was my second time attending a practice I wasn't supposed to be at, I had acquired an in school suspension for a day. Writing this part is kind of spotty because my mind intentionally forgets details as though it is a recollection of abuse. She explained I wasn't eligible to participate in the dress rehearsal, as my grades wouldn't be updated until the following Monday, and due to that fact I would miss both dress rehearsals and be pretty much ineligible to be in the performance of the musical I already didn't enjoy my part in, that I had attended nearly two dozen practices for over the course of the past school year. I promptly explained this to the musical director (who was nearly a father figure to me) tearfully and promptly stormed out to my car. 

I didn't attend school very often the last half of my senior year due to depression and apathy for my friends. The way I saw it at the time was that they were all complacent in my rejection, and all had equal part in my torment. I am unsure as to why but I accepted a role as narrator in the fall/Christmas play which that year was A Christmas Carol. My grades were fine the whole time, until a switch flipped when I realized that I would have to skip out on college in a couple months because of the love of my mother (who couldn't be left alone). I went as far as to tour the college I wasn't going to go to. The drive home felt like a trip to my grave. To this date it is one of my only regrets. Not because I think it would have solved any problems, but because I missed out on an opportunity that was simply skipped over because I followed the advice and compassion for my mother. 

Contrary to popular belief I did in fact get my high school diploma, thanks in no small part to my loving mother. I constantly believe that I was smarter than any person in my graduating class, I just refused to play the same game that they did. It hurts quite a lot to go back and view pictures of those from my graduating class, the simple fact of knowing I would have been above all of it if I had simply bitten my lip and enjoyed the last few months of my high school education it would have ended amicably, instead of what actually happened. Three months prior to graduation my attendance fell drastically. I had immense struggle to get out of bed most days, and on my worst days I refused to get out of bed and threatened violence against myself behind locked doors as a plea for attention and quietude in the personal effects of an impossible decision of going to school and abandoning my mother, or finding a shit job and being there for Her. I barley even finished my final project which was a web design project for a business literally 500 feet from my house. The worst part about this period is probably what I realized after the fact. I made good decisions in everything except in where I paid my attention. The web design final project platform I used is now the market leader in web design (square-space), the form of code I decided to learn (C++) is now the most popular version for web development. And lastly the YouTube channel I started in 2015 and stopped producing videos on, is now that largest growing category on YouTube (video essays). I have an entire catalog of lessons to be learned from this era of my life, if only I would actually learn instead of being bitter and stagnant in hatred and malcontent for the peers who steered me wrong in this time. 

Absentminded stagnation is how I would describe the time that followed graduation. Nearly a year and a half of quietly trying to make my life the most comfortable it could be. The lack of memory speaks to the state of mind I was in during this time. I viewed any sort of "work" as something not worth seeking. All the while being the most negative version I remember of myself, most days barely getting out of bed with less than 12hrs of sleep. I am my own constant ruination during this stage of my life. My mother tried her best to get me out of the slump I found myself, but no matter her efforts I stayed stagnant without influence from friends or family. Most of my school friends pretty much abandoned me immediately (showing their actual level of care) but some stuck by my side, forging the path by way of their own lives (going to college, along with companionship) I follow them now, for better or worse but delayed is better than never at all. Luckily it turns out that college is accessible even after high school.

My First Job was at Weis markets, in Gap PA. I am unable to find bank records of it(which is alarming) but I believe it was around when I was 19-20. The main thing I recall is that it was confusingly accordant to regulations. People would constantly claim it was against regulation and then violate the rule they were setting, I remember most how my ankles hurt when I started, I was unused to constant standing in place, it seemed so inconsequential even when based on the current state of things (it burned down in 2020-2022 not sure). I quit in 2020 due to lack of attendance, I was lazy, not fit for a job or a place and probably deserving a firing round if I was honest with myself.

My Second Job was  at Dutch Wonderland. I was so infatuated with video games namely Rust, that I was unable to maintain my consequences to myself. I have a major memorty when I recall myself

Session 3 (7/20/24)

*(Recap from session 2)* 
To start off the session we are greeted with a flashback of Sazen underground along with three other figures. Eventually the figures are assaulted by a burgeoning artery from the sewer system liked to the area they stood.
Resuming from last session we come back to Aorta's Workshop, with Skreep being sniffed by Druzil. 
Aorta tells them to seek a person at The Pathfinder's guild and gives them a silver metallic cylinder. Inside are a Vial of high purity Juice and a Certification of Contract from Opportunity. 
The Party travels the guild square, heading for The Pathfinders guild. 
We meet our first Harvestman just before arriving at the guild.
Upon arrival at the registration center, the party takes a little too long to realize Velyr the person sent to meet them representing the Consortium. 
The party gets some slow service but eventually meets with the clerk for the Consortium's Registrar and get registered to become Prospectors by the Authority of the Consortium. 
On our way back to Aorta's Workshop the party passes by the Page and the Fool traveling together in a palanquin in the streets of the guild square. Skreep senses their mind being toyed with and runs ahead of the group fleeing to the workshop. Illayra is compelled to skip along. 
Arriving back at the workshop Skreep is drawing tarot cards at the table when they arrive. 
Aorta recognizes their new prospector's certification and tells them to seek their goal. 
Thump approaches Druzil about his offer of "wetwork" and discovers that Skreep, Thump, Illayra and Druzil all speak Draconic. 
Druzil says that The Fleshcrafter's are currently offering a contract on killing Dianne Julii for an indeterminate amount of gold and her son Leto Julii for a lesser amount of (250gp). 
The gang stops at a friendly juice bar (insert name here), and meets Verona and her servant Bob. They sell their Juice for 55 gold and get some information

Session 2 (7/13/24)

*(Recap from session 1)* 
Individually Introducing Thump & Illarya, then Skreep then Sazen. The party each meets a strange person in a plague doctors mask they eventually learn to be named "Argus". They meet initially at a tavern in a small town to the south named The Bleeding Heart. They are invited to chat by the man who invited them to the tavern to come upstairs. 
When everyone has a seat at the table everyone is introduced to The Page, a member of the Court of Opportunity. After a discussion it is determined that they will hear out a contract from the leader of the Fleshcrafter's Guild named Aorta. It is decided that they will head north to Opportunity. 
On the way North, having left Argus the party is attacked by a group of women traveling south on the Saint's road. Having been ambushed, the party is found winded on the side of the road by both Argus and the Page's royal companions and guards. 
On the way into the city it is evident this is no safe or normal place to be, some people seem to be evacuating. 
Led by Argus the party makes their way into the Fleshcrafter's guild in Opportunities Guild Square. 
Leaving them at the door Argus makes sure none of the party members are bleeding. 
The Party meets Aorta for the first time... A pleasure I'm sure.

Skreep: 
Ask around if anyone has heard of the name Verona (Private) [S1 Complete]

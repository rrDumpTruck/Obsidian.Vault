Degree's I think are worth pursuing:
Computer Science: 
	Related to software and systems of computation.
	What is learned: Computer systems, AI, networks, lots of programming and software
Computer Engineering: 
	More related to the physical field of computers. 
	What is learned: Hardware, Electrical signals, physics, very hard math 
Electrical Engineering: 
	Design, develop, test, and supervise the manufacture of electrical equipment. Basically everything a CE is and then some.
	What is learned: Circuits, very hard math, physics. 
History: 
	Not really a viable outcome... lower salary, job choice and value of degree.
Psychology: 
	The road for a psychologist is long and can take far more than 4 years of schooling, is very expensive and hard to transfer. Salary is ok but job demand may dwindle/ be unrecognizable by the time I have all required education. 


Thoughts on progress and which school(s) to choose: 
The ball must start rolling. Find a school, ask the hard questions. Prepare for a fight.

Depending on which community college I go to I may be able to waive the SATs. 
Go to community college for gen ed. courses to save money.
Transfer credits to as highly accredited an online program as I can.

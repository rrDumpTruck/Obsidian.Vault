Background info for recruiting and game time/rules

-Game time: Saturday 
-Game length/frequency: I hope to play 4 hour sessions unless that conflicts with peoples schedules. 
-Game system: 5e DND unless some other system works better some how in future
-Game location: Over discord (mic required/cam optional), and played on Foundry VTT
-Class/Race restrictions: No restrictions unless I find something that doesn't really work with the world's logic or lore. Generally people have a someone darker theme in the world of the Veins due to its founders being more or less demonic. You may choose to play a character that is less fitting to the setting but it will be noticeable in crowds, dialogue and various other interactions in the game.

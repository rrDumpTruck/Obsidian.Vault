Background info for recruiting and game time/rules

-Game time: Saturday 
-Game length/frequency: I hope to play 4 hour sessions unless that conflicts with peoples schedules. 
-Game system: 5e DND unless some other system works better some how in future
-Game location: Over discord (mic required/cam optional), and played on Foundry VTT
-Class/Race restrictions: No restrictions unless I find something that doesn't really work with the world's logic or lore. Generally people have a someone darker theme in the world of the Veins due to its founders being more or less demonic. You may choose to play a character that is less fitting to the setting but it will be noticeable in crowds, dialogue and various other interactions in the game.

# **Goal-Based Experience**

No more encounter based XP - if you fight something for no reason, you’re not rewarded for it.

Goal and Quest based XP - a goal is a player-set objective, a quest is an NPC or Faction-set objective. Goals apply to individual PCs, Quests apply to the entire group.

Each character has three Goal Slots, which can be filled with a Goal to be achieved. Such as;

- “I want to find out a secret of the world”
    
- “I want to make friends or get closer to (insert party member here)”
    
- “I want to steal something of value and sell it for profit”
    
- “I want to save someone from the brink of death”
    
- “Escape from the castle”
    
- “Enter the dark woods”
    

The GM assesses the difficulty of the goal, and assigns it a category; “Easy, Medium, Hard, Deadly” based on narrative likelihood they’ll succeed, obstacles in the way, etc.

  

Category of the goal is equated to an XP value. Achieving the goal means getting the XP.

  

GOALS: XP values are Encounter Difficulty*3 in XP value

QUESTS: XP values are Encounter Difficulty*4 in XP value

[Encounter Calculator](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/building-combat-encounters#CombatEncounterDifficulty)

Same goes for Quests the difficulty is similarly adjusted and the source is external.

- “Go to the Tower of Hell’s Fury and Kick the Wizard in his Butt”
    

  

Attempting to accomplish a goal or quest and failing means no XP, too bad, you failed. This is not an XP for a failing model. However, taking a meaningful risk in pursuit of the goal (usually a roll or some investment is involved) nets a player 50 x their level in XP for ongoing pursuit. 

  

Goals can be changed at the start of the session or abandoned at any time.

  

If a goal is resolved during a session, you don’t just get to write a new one.

  

THE POINT: the players now have a method for telling ME what they want in the game and mechanically invest the players via their characters in the game itself

  

Occasionally: The DM will provide discretionary difficulty hints (when a task seems easy and in fact would be very challenging or impossible, I will never tell you a goal is a secret difficulty additionally letting you know when a goal has gotten easier, but will usually respond to the question in a one sentence answer. 

The DM may occasionally provide bonus XP to certain goals per session or even at time of completion.

Hold Action Multiattack

When you hold your action for an attack, you can take all the attacks you’re normally entitled to.

Non-playable Races

Most races are fine, if there is a certain race that may not show up in my setting, ask me, I'm sure we can homebrew something. 

  

Anything (including spells/feats) from Unearthed arcana is not game tested, and is most likely unbalanced for gameplay. I may allow it, but do so with scrutiny.

---

Encumbrance - “Gold” weighs nothing, I don't care, go nuts. If its reasonable I will probably let you carry over your weight, unless you are carrying another player or npc.

PVP - Try not to do it, it makes everything a lot less fun due to D&D not being balanced for it. 

If someone tells you to stop or make reasonable requests during RP, due to them feeling uncomfortable, you have to.**

Overview
	I am thinking this setting as being inspired by a setting on a old Rollplay show called Court of Swords, specifically the place called The Court of the Void. The culture and time setting will be different but the concepts of vein hunters, and cities built secretly on top of large ones. The settings best part will come when the party learns of the second part of the setting, they are in a different plane and the overworld exists (probably hint with an object made of a material only in the overworld). They will uncover a hidden mystery and why the two planes were created (main story seed).

Time
	I think I want this to be outside of normal fantasy settings with some allegorical connections to pop culture and history. A dark perverse place haunted by demons of the past and present, feelings of an ultimate evil obscured by time.

Themes
	This will be an anxious, dark, regal one with momentary parts horror and mischief or frivolity.

Personal Goals
	I want this to be equal parts challenging and self indulging for me. An opportunity to meet different types of people and let there stories form my future and current ones. Hopefully we can find some people who care about this as much as I can when in the deep end of world building and roleplaying.
### First Imagining

You see a flowing stream, quick clear vapors with little blue glistering specks of shining in some light overhead emanating from a hole in the sky crimson sky, black as pitch. A dark greyish red landscape dotted by crevices known as The Veins by everyone who calls this place home. Things here don't change, not without a little special treatment at least. Unless you imbue something with The Juice; a substance retrieved from fissures by people called Vein Hunters. The object recovers any harm that is done to it every day at sunrise. Memories never fade, people old or young never advance their age past their current one.

Through your delirious wandering your blurred eyes scan the horizon and see the outline of a jagged edged angular looking city in the far distance. A tower stands at the center of this city, a lighthouse looking building with flashes of magenta light coming from the topmost windows...

  

Large Cities are on top of Fractures, large versions of fissures that lead to the overworld but whose entrances are tightly controlled by very powerful people.

<span style="color:#ffc000">Life Without Juice</span>
	Life with none of the substance would look very much like a "normal world" but everyone would die of starvation before anything did anything. Normal food does not satiate your needs, only food and liquids treated by the juice can fully nourish you. 

<span style="color:#ffc000">The Effects of the Juice</span>
	*The following is assuming a normal sized adult human/humanoid). 
	The Substance seems to scale linearly.*
	If a person goes 4 days without the Juice they start to lose distant memories, 10 and they start to age biologically, 20 and they start to erode away over the course of a week. 
	Those Under the effects of the juice seem to be a little stronger, smarter and faster than those who try not using it. While using it your wounds heal faster, your memories fade far slower and your lifespan is very much increased. 

<span style="color:#ffc000">Aging</span> 
	When someone decides they want to have a child, they petition their Formless Lord. If deemed worthy they are allowed to have an offspring of normal means. Otherwise everything will fail to function as normal. 
	When the baby is born if given juice immediately they stay a baby until the Juice is no longer supplied. The General practice is unless the child is sick they should stay off the juice until after puberty at the earliest, 20 is recommended. 
	Any person if older than 100 may be deemed unnecessary by the local Lord and reclaimed for a new mortal creature. This is very infrequent and usually used in direct punishment. 

<span style="color:#ffc000">The Industry Behind the Scenes</span>
	Starting from the beginning, a person who wishes to become a Vein Hunter must first have requisite experience working in another persons outfit or have a degree from a permitted school. They are then gifted with a Prospectors permit. Which costs 10gp. With this you could prospect possible claims and sell reports if they could be worthwhile. 
	The next test is to find a pathfinder and  hire his services to help you qualify for the next licensing step which is the Vein Hunters Permit. 

<span style="color:#00b050">GEOLOGY and JUICEOLOGY </span>
	The world of the veins is a largely cavernous and eroded place, a large amount of ground gives way easily and is not stable to build on due to being eroded by the juice's flow. Regenerating in most ways over time the landscape continues to adapt to the lifeforms that live on it. 
	Mining operations must be undertaken with a preapplication of the Juice due to the soil regenerating if not treated with trace amounts of it during The Watchers Gaze. 
	The Juice flows through everything and everyone in small ways, and big ones. The things we call The Veins are referring to the small Capillaries that hold small amounts of impure juice. The juice in the Capillaries travel through the Veins, then The Arteries and returns back to the Convergence. 

Types of Veins
	-Capillaries - Hold small, impure amounts, very common
	-Vein - The Large thing rope like strands of interwoven capillaries 5-10 feet wide  places that tie different regions sets of capillaries together. Once Properly interwoven the Veins become so tough that nothing can penetrate them. Veins are also responsible for transporting Juice to the Arties and then back to the Convergence. 
	-Arteries - Huge 20-40ft chords of veins turning into a conglomerate of glowing blue energy that transports back to The Convergence, then back to the Fountain.  
	-Heart(Convergence)

A Fissure 
	Occasionally a procedure is undertaken where Pathfinders are able to divine a location where a Vein is weak enough to possibly be Opened. If the difficult task of finding a weak point is succeeded Juice will deluge out of the vein until it seals itself in time. 

A Fracture
	Occasionally an event takes place where an Artery is burst or ruptured in some way, a Fracture takes place, usually destroying anything in a very large radius. The open wound will continue to heal over time, sending more Juice to that area trying to repair it. These events are rare, and have been the arriving point of The Herald in Opportunity. 

Fissure Creation
	A fissure is capable of withstanding all but the most powerful of explosions or the sharpest of spells and knives. 

<span style="color:#c00000">SECRET DM VEIN STUFF</span>
	- When created a Fissure will last 10d10 days before sealing itself, during the last half of the duration the flow rate is reduced by half. 
	- When created a Fracture lasts for 100 years at least, as far as we can tell. 

Death and Dying
	The World of the Veins is a harsh place, inevitably you will end up facing a fight you cannot win, or meeting an obstacle you couldn't have foreseen. In cases of death, most creatures seem to return to life within 4-8 cycles. 
	During a persons death, strange hallucinations have been witnessed and a mortal occasion is typically met with memory loss of the entire previous cycle as well as in some rare cases where people lose weeks or months worth of memories. Some rare cases show resurected people forgetting a specific person or item as well. 
	In cases where a person loses a limb, head or even entire body the following takes place. 
	A minor limb such as an arm, leg or extremity grows back within the usual 4-8 cycles but generally grows back worse and worse with each damage instance, making you less capable as a whole. 
	The loss of a head is somewhat rare, usually resulting in a much changed personality. 
	The loss of a whole body, usually in the case of incineration or grave magical damage is not the end of a denizen of The Vein's life. After a long while (2d6 weeks) the person is resurrected in the controlled capital city of their Formless Lord.

## Channel Planning

Name: TBD

Content: Ongoing monthly/every few weeks, covering mainly cultural ideas and content that excites me and I find deeper meaning to. 

Main goals: 

Leading others to meaningfully understand the non-obvious and ask more than surface level questions about things that they are drawn to. 

A sharing of personal reflection about my enjoyment of a piece of art or history. 

  

  

  

Some thoughts on how to structure my videos: 

I’ll list some ideas that I have based on what I have seen is “industry standard” and list my thoughts as well as pros and cons of each. 

  

“Video Essay”: A brief plot synopsis followed by interesting facts about the media I am presenting, then follow up with interesting ideas the movie presents, cinematic overtures that it uses to convey information and lastly my personal thoughts on the media and some sentiment on how it’s effected my life. This lends to the video generally being a total view on both sides (good and bad) of the media. 

Channels I know of that use this format: @JacobGeller, @CinemaStix. @TheCanvasArtHistory

|---|---|
|Pros|Cons|
|- Comes across as well thought <br>- Forces you to be thorough<br>- Grants a “complete picture”<br>- Represents multi faceted issues well (both sides of critique)|- Videos will usually take/be longer<br>- Unopinionated nature could lead to boredom<br>- Takes more patience to watch<br>- Can easily come across as derivative|

  

**“The One Sided Critique”**: Assume that the audience has seen the media, present most general views on the matter. Follow this up with sequential supporting evidence, ignoring most “questionable” points about the media. This lends to videos that feel shorter and more concise, due to lack of need to structure it in an argumentative and logical view but ultimately allows the content to fit into other categories of media easier due to its lack of extreme subject depth.

| - Lighthearted and “popcorn”<br>- Easier to make (self propelled nature)<br>- Clearer tone (lack of outside influence)<br>- More flexibility in content (decreased time investment) | - Won’t teach me as much<br>- Lacks gravitas required by some media<br>- Less room to ask questions in videos (lack of dual sided criticism) |

  

“The Cynical/Mocking Review”: A very brief plot synopsis, followed by what the media does or doesn’t do well. Followed with a objective view on how popular the media is and why it is that way. Lastly my personal views and opinions on the media with supporting evidence of why I think this. This lends to the video being more laid back at the start, and more subjective while being easier to watch due to the lack of rigidity.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Pros|Cons|
|- Laid back and comical<br>- Concise (comedic timing)<br>- Less audience investment<br>- Staying power (radical viewers = more long term support?)|- Less audience investment<br>- Highly subjective views on things (lack of dual perspective critique)<br>- A difficulty expressing complex ideas (jumps in reasoning required by assumption of shared subjectivity)|

  

“Objective Philosophy”: A brief synopsis of the video followed by an in depth philosophical view on the setting, the characters, and the major themes surrounding the media. Lastly how this media effected my life and what I like/dislike about it. This lends to ideas being more lofty, and a much easier writing process with some major work needed in the background supporting texts of major philosophers.

|---|---|
|Pros|Cons|
|- Probably the most creatively available of the four<br>- Reduced investment (but still higher than some)<br>-  Will probably teach me valuable knowledge on writing and philosophy<br>- Larger audience than just the media itself|- May go over some people’s heads<br>- More required learning on character tropes and philosophies<br>-|

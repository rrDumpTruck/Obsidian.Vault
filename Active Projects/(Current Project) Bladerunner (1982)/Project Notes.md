Why You Love A Hero Who Doesn't Matter | Blade Runner 2049 (((SHANE BERTRAM)))

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JP3Rv-x3uI&t=210s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JP3Rv-x3uI&t=210s)

summary and relevance? 
	A video that describes the decision and its aim for making the main character (joe) completely disposable and how he doesn't ultimately matter. Joe was gifted a memory, that ultimately was not his own, but given to him by a godlike watcher (the memory maker). Talks about "humanlike nobility" and how our humanity isn't our physicality, but rather the choices we make. 
	Ultimately the video came off as sensationalizing a singular part of the story, surrounded by many similar points without overtly critical thoughts. Relevant when I make this video but not by nature of being made by another content creator.

Production notes: 

Entire sets the size of a city block were erected in Burbank during the filming. Originally Philip K. Dick rejected two separate directors (Martin Scorsese and Herb Jaffe) in the 1970s. By the time  Ridley Scott came to into the picture he almost didn’t want to take it, but after reconsidering he left his role of Director for the Dune movie that was in production in 1981 and began filming on Blade Runner. The production began without informing the author of the book it was based on Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep. Philip K. Dick died shortly before the movies release on March 2, 1982. 

The film is known for its amazing special effects and techniques new for just this specific movie but largely used a lot of knowledge earned by Close Encounters of the Third Kind from 1977

The second film ever to be released on DVD, the first is “A Time to kill”.

**Notes from watching (started 6/8/23)**

scrolling text giving backstory at the beginning? who started this trend

-Tyrell corp creates nexus 6 (intellectually equal to the engineers who designed them)

the pacing of the start and the way that it conducts its initial characterization of not only the city but the systemic oppression that “the future” could be 

6:40 : the pacing at which the questions from the detective are answered by the man in the chair, paired with the detectives reactions from his diagnostic tools help drive the audience to be on the accusatory side of whatever this test may be. The poignant response when asked about his mother makes the audience realize that the stakes are high, and shocks the audience into a sense of solitary discomfort feeling now isolated from the mouthpiece for the audience. 

The film makes Deckard stand out being the only one seated in a busy street, reading a newspaper and people watching. He tries to buy food and is isolated from the interaction because they do not speak the same language. He is ambushed by Gaff and taken to the police station to receive a new assignment, we learn that this man is an recently retired (hehe) blade runner named Rick Deckard. 

Deckard is shown the interview from the beginning of the movie, and told the details of the remaining rogue crew including the man from the interview named Leon. We also receive more information on the Nexus 6 replicants and their limited four year lifespan. 

We make our way to Tyrell corp and meet Rachel and Eldon Tyrell. Rachel is given a voightkampf test by Deckard, she then fails the test after being told about a boiled dog being served at dinner. Eldon tells Deckard about how Rachel is a newer experimental model. 

Deckard and Gaff investigate a place that the replicants stayed and pick up a few clues, a fake nail and a stack of pictures. 

We see Roy Batty and Leon at “Eye World” where Roy interrogates the lab owner about where to find Eldon Tyrell, he instead gives them J.F. Sebastian an engineer for Tyrell Corp. 

Rachel ambushes Deckard on the way back to his apartment. Rachel has questions about the test and why Eldon Tyrell won’t see her anymore. She comes in and they share drinks. He tells her memories that noone could know, implants given to her by Tyrell. He tries to be sympathetic after making fun of the situation but she leaves after he goes off to make her a drink.  

We meet Pris as she sets an ambush for J.F. Sebastian when he invites her in from the rain after being told she was homeless

Deckard has a dream about a white horse, after a long night of drinking he puts some pieces together finding in one of the pictures left by Leon a woman. He takes the other object he found to a appraiser of some sort, finding it to be the scale off of a snake. Deckard finds the snake salesman then the snake buyer a who is a nightclub owner. While at the nightclub Deckard invites Rachel and is turned down. Deckard meets Zhora, a snake related “performance artist”, after faking his identity to get closer to her she finally realizes the jig is up and flees the scene, ultimately being killed by Deckard in a chase. 

Deckard spots Rachel from across the street and is ambushed by Leon who was watching him the whole time. Rachel intervenes, killing Leon and they go back to his place to finish those drinks he promised. 

-1:05:35 the way that Rachels eyes glow in the way a predators do at night. 

Rachel asks Deckard about her insept date and how long she will live. She makes a recommendation that he should take the voightkampf test. During the night Rachel changes her hair to make herself look more like the woman from Deckard’s photos. Rachel finds some sheet music and starts to play piano, she states that she didn’t know if she could play that she didn’t know if that skill came from her own experience or Tyrell’s niece. They share a fun (if not rapey) time during the night. 

Pris gives herself a strange makeover and wakes up Sebastian. 

-1:14:00 Pris’s eyes have the same predator reflection. 

Roy Batty lets himself in and meets Pris and Sebastian. While making breakfast Sebastian figures out that they are replicants, and have a limited time to figure out their expiration date problems. 

1:20:00 the eye contact after Sebastian leaves the room 

--the red eye effect is an extreme extreme example of dramatic irony.

Roy uses Sebastian and Eldon’s chess game to gain entry, allowing Roy to ask Eldon to fix his expiration date. Eldon tells him that its not possible to fix him due to many high level genetic and virologic reasons. 

1;26;00 Roy’s eyes while he kills Eldon Tyrell. 

While listening to police radio along with Deckard we learn about Eldon Tyrell 

being found with J.F. Sebastian dead. Deckard calls Sebastian and gets Pris instead, this leads him to visit his apartment where Roy and Pris have laid a trap.  

1:33:00 the death of Pris and her terrifying movements and screaming lead the audience to have an empathetic response, similar to what the voightkampf test was like. 

Pris hides in plain sight along with Sebastians other creations. Ambushing Deckard it seems Pris may actually beat him but then Deckard shoots her as she tries to do a fancy kick. 

Roy Batty speaks menacingly about how well he already knows Deckard. 

1:37:00 Roy shows emotion about Pris’s death, seemingly a new emotion. 

Roy seemingly gone mad, strips naked and chases Deckard to the roof of Sebastian’s apartment building. During the chase Roy drives a nail into his palm hoping to stay alive longer. Roy even encourages Deckard to run away. 

--what are the chants (4,5... 6, 7...) about and where did they come from? 

-the scenes in the chase are typically single portrait shots of Roy or Deckard, each exhibiting the same emotions (pain, fear, etc.) 

“quite and experience to live in fear isn’t it? That’s what it is to be a slave” (((could the is have a different meaning?)))

Roy saves Deckard from a ledge he slipped off of during the chase. 

1:45:00 everything from the tears in the rain monologue and onward has extra meaning behind it, more investigation required. Gaff as a character has something hidden. 

Deckard comes home to find Rachel alive and tries to get her out of the building to run from something? _what are they running from?_ 

Deckard finds a foil unicorn. 

“It’s too bad she won’t live, but then again... who does?”

find out what the paper animals mean.

**Plot Summary:**   

Bladerunner is a film made in 1982, directed by Ridley Scott and written by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples loosely based on the book Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick in 1968. The film is set in the far off future year of 2019 in a dystopian Los Angeles. The film follows the consequences of Tyrell Corp, who invented a series of synthetic humans of varying models called Replicants. The newest model of these Replicants are known as “Nexus 6” Models” and they were largely used in slave labor for the exploration and colonization of other planets. They are illegal on earth, under penalty of death. The newest “Nexus 6” Replicants are much more capable of physical tasks, have better reaction time and are visually and mentally “at least equal” to the engineers who designed them. Knowing this, Tyrell Corp designed them with a shortened lifespan, 4 years after the Replicants “Insept” date they start to age rapidly, and then die... this process is the crux of the film. 

Our story starts by way of a scrolling wall of text giving us a brief summation of the setting and main characters of the world. (Fun Fact: This style of scrolling expositional text was first used in the TV series Flash Gordon.) Most importantly it informs us of what a Bladerunner is, a special police squad used for the “Retirement” of replicants that were found on Earth. 

After a brief establishing shot of Tyrell Corp, we are greeted with an interview.

Skreep's secret interaction with Druzil: 


<span style="color:#c00000">SIDE: The Fool *(Inverse)*'s Carnival
</span>	The fool is holding a carnival starting in The Narrow's and leading all the way up to Damocan's Grounds for the main event. The parade has many stops along the way up to the grounds. Pausing at the fighting pits for a scheduled 3 rounds of fighting.

<span style="color:#ff0000">MAIN QUEST</span>: <span style="color:#c00000">Aorta</span> is negotiating a deal between the party and an anonymous buyer (The Consortium.  
 
<span style="color:#00b050">The Consortium</span> 
	Are looking for a new location to invest their hard earned wealth in. For some reason the location that they have in mind is an decrepit castle to the far north of Opportunity off in an area lost inside the maze of The Obsidian Peak. ***They have the blueprints for a the same weapon that the Stygian Forest used on Elysia.  

	The Consortium's reason for surveying the land is somewhat of a trick. They are interested in the lands surrounding the fissure but know that something lingers here. But they don't want their contractor to find out because it will save them gold.

###### When the Party goes to leave the city a large dragon flies overhead, 
###### Red and with a sheen like a pool of blood the dragon flies up to Kaom's Keep

Howling Plateau Encounters: 
1.Vein Spiders. 
	Creatures lying in wait in larger streams of the juice in the wilds of the Howling Plateau. Their spindly legs make deadly weapons and their agility makes them appear to move like water.

	that will negotiate (DC14 Persuasion Check) but must be bribed or intimidated to be bypassed. Use 2xBandit and 2xThug. 
3.The party sees a mirage in the distance
	If they succeed in chasing it three times (DC 14 Survival Check) it leads them to a chest of items that contains (A bag of Maleorite shards, A topaz gold ring with the engraving "To My Love", a bag of a strange black sand like substance, three Irons ) 

<span style="color:#ffc000">ENTER THE MAZE OF PEAKS</span>
	"The Area" lies on the other side of a place the The Obsidian Peak. A series of spline-like mountains of obsidian and granite. It twists and winds while leaving hundreds of feet overhead of rock and sky. 
	<span style="color:#c00000">The party must make</span> a series of (2-4) navigation checks based on how good they do <span style="color:#c00000">DC 14 Survival Check</span>, if they fail everyone must make a <span style="color:#c00000">DC 13 Dexterity Save</span> or take <span style="color:#ffff00">1d6</span> Slashing damage from having to do various maneuvers. 

After arriving there they find large sections of veins leading out of the rocks and to two buildings. A small barn like building with 2 bedrooms, and 
A wood and stone tower about a hundred feet from the barn. 

As they approach the tower they see a large hole headed deeper into the earth, with veins on every surface.

"Where did I leave my Aorta" or "<span style="color:#c00000">Aorta</span>" - A squelching mass of arms, the thing known as Aorta has a pinkish red hue allover its bodies various and numbered joints. Ligaments, arteries, fingers, mouths, tongues and the end and beginning of this creature is held in question. Eventually they seem to open the central cavity and a short cylindrical web of muscle fibers, tendons and nerve endings lead up to a globe of eyes. Some darting, some scanning, some staring... all manner of beast, fish, man and even some you don't recognize seem to look through you. 

You hear a rhythmic undulation around you begin as you hear in <span style="color:#ffc000">syncopated speech</span> <span style="color:#7030a0">"Welcome to my Workshop dearies."</span> It takes a moment but you realize on the outside of their central cavity is a scattering of mouths each placed in a different orientation. Their lips move and they speak a single chord with a note of each octave, but corrupt like an record player at the bottom of a well. 
	<span style="color:#ffff00">Druzil</span> - A three foot tall pale green homunculus that is a servant for the great Aorta. Cleaning up the workshop, gathering important materials, doing tedious paperwork, etc.

# <span style="color:#ffc000">The Precursors</span>
	The precursors are those who exist in the plane of The Veins, but are stuck as outside observers due to their immense power. You may call on them but at great peril. 

**<span style="color:#ff0000">Eresiod</span>** - Also known as “THE WATCHER” by the denizens of The Veins, he is responsible for The Vein's habitation by mortal men. Initially used as an experiment in his attempt to create a tap of power coming out of The Basin in the overworld. 
Being found out and eventually punished for his crime by his once brothers and sisters in the Devoted, he knew he must put a backup plan in place that couldn't fail. So he made a small change to the spell responsible for creating the siphon in The Basin. 
The spell would cause him and anyone who remained inside of the portal that would create the hole and the reservoir Eresiod had created for the magic of The Basin to reside. The plan went well executed but like he had suspected he was caught. 
While the ritual to both create the world of The Veins was being undertaken in the overworld, Ersiod's wife Verona had managed to make it into the circle without being noticed, sending her soul and energy along with Ersiod's into the world of The Veins. 
Once the Devoted realized what Eresiod had accomplished they worked together to plan. The Basin is an extension and symbol of a thing called 
The Fountain
	The Fountain is the source of all magical power in the universe. It is made up of the souls of all sentient life, and is located in The Beyond but can be seen from the overworld as it flows down into the Basin.
Barely defeated by The Devoted Eresiod and Verona both shared the blame of their crime. Ersiod's was to watch as his lifeforce was split from his soul, his soul becoming a sun over the land, his life splitting into 44 explorers and descending into each crack of The Veins. 

One of the Devoted, Halessian the Thinker was tasked with finding a fair punishment for god level subterfuge and treason. She came up with this...
Ersiod's Land would only change through the power of those who had bested their master. All his children growing and living false lives through the power of the foe he gave his existence to cheat. 
Every morning the full force of Ersiod's hatred is felt through a brief red gaze cast on everyone and everything incinerating anything that isn't infused with The Juice. 
Every afternoon Ersiod's face changes to a grin, reviving those who have passed on unless unworthy
Every night Ersiod's face changes to a grimace. (Secretly removing memories and playing tricks on your mind.)

**<span style="color:#ff0000">Verona</span>** - Ersiod's Widow, still worshipped and some say that she maintains a stronghold somewhere in the veins plotting revenge on the Devoted.

First and foremost fuck your spelling and puncutation, it can be corrected later, you must let the thoughts flow then go back and fix them later. Secondly feel your emotions and let them flow here and be honest with yourself about them so that you have a full and thourough flow of inner dialouge. 

I am a broken man. A man nontheless... I have all my life felt like something was missing, I have trouble starting this thought simply due to the difficult nature of the questions it encompasses. First thing that comes to mind is the fact that I feel simultaneously that I worship a god that I dont belive in, yet part of me has the firm belief that there is no other way for our existence to be a thing. It feels like the only way and the least likely, it enfuriates me so. 

I have a problem with vice. I hate the station that is provided me, but feel that it would haunt me as a ghost haunts a trespasser. I need to figure out why I do not like the common state of mind that I enjoy on a daily basis, I feel asleep always... as if I have been and currently am a walking talking ghostg, followed by this informative tfact that I live and breath lies and disinformation about my station. I can change it but fors ome resson I chose not to, all that it would take is to journey past where ewe have been before. Either take a step forward or leave the world behind it makes no sense otherwise... yet here i STAND. 

I am enfuritated by the world around me. I am subjected to the abso9lute torment of a wasted potential that I have had in my life. I feel like it could change at any momment but for some reason I cant figure out, I stay stagnant in my ways... other than accepting "god as my lord and savior" I have made no markable progres in the way that I view the world. AEven at that, some days I feel it is a lie I tell myself to keep from giving in entirely. If only I could go back and tell myself to continue your vicious progress towards whatever you deem necesary, the world would be ab teter place for it. I onlywish that this txt were going anywhere at all but I think it may fall on ears never to be heard. Ever person of potentiality has been faced with this wall of verisimilutde, these thoughts plague me as a locust plagues a swarm. I only wishe someone would come and fix me. but seems to me no matter what I try noone wants my depressing ass next to them while they preservere their own troubled path. Everyone lies to themselves, including me, thknning they hv ave nocontrol over what it is that they would do, could do, will do... I simply want every one to live their life as they would if no conflict existed in this world. Conflict of inner, outer, and upper self plagues those qwith weak winds (which is most of us) the only way I was able to change my path is when I ignored everyting but a set jpath and nearly killd myself with my endurance. Prior to my belife in god I belived that all divinity was the process of man completeing his will. But after I witnessed what one mans divinity meant to anohter I changed my outlook on man. I now think man is a simple beast without process, every decision is a predefined notion  based on the consequences of his surroundings and his upbringing. 

My sister plays  abig part in my outlook on life. She had every possibility to make e3very thing better, and was well underway but got crushed by the progress of man, at le3ast I believe that she was troubled mainly by that progress of man so common as procreation. every person she met tried to cotroll her actions and way of beeing that she simply folded under the prssure... like I am nearing to. If I had less coping mechanisms I would have folded a long time ago. But I feel my emotions in a healthy way  what are you even talking about your piece of shit your litterally the textbook def. of a person who uses vice to solve thieir proble3msbs. Get better and deal with your own shit before talking about someone else. Even if she is my sistswer and I love her, I am able to see her problems, while it isn't a badc thing she used her ability of woo'ing men to abandon her own children, and if she was able to do that then I am able to so much worse because of my nature of being a stoic introspctor. It seems to me the best course of action is to try and interrogate her to find  her ability to ignore her emotions in a effort to figbure out what is wrong with mue but ath seems ulikely to solve anything, becuase more than likley she did those things involentarily due to her "nature" I hope that I can be better but ( doubt it if I am being honest with myuself. 

It is becoming ever more obvious to me that I need to ask for heplp from someone who understantds these type of problems, there has eto be some kind of person that is able to fix the ciclical pattern that my brain is ikn currently. 

I see a thing that needs to be done, look at all the details and find onereason of chance that the thing that causes  me pause has over my situation, and decide not to execute. This  one problem is the thing that causes me the most pain in my life I think. My drinking, past smoking, and even my worldview is caused by this one problem I think. But then again I had the idea that my hearty was failing and that turend out to just be an anxiety problem. A regual rhearrtt beat, nearly perfect bloodwork, minor vitimin deficiency, and for some reason I have a hard time beliving that I am ok. I want to be thankful to god, but I fear that he doesn't exist and that I am lying to myself about his existence to mane myself feel better. Where do I end and god begin, where do my actions remain my own and gods pressing feelings cause action, or inaction. Why can someone belive in predestination and also belivn gfreewill. It makes no sense to me. Why do I have this probelm... I thkn it lies in my refusal to understanc the dsubconcious mind... basically my mind subsides in two categories, subconcious and concious. Every mistake I have ever made was due to my previous expericnce influencing my subconcious min or my active mind going agaist my instincts (my unconcious mind) I feeel my unconcious mind stopped progressing passivley just after high school, maybe afte3r my cesation of consistant reading at hershey farm... I think it is possible that it ceases edevelopment when you reach a certain age, but that may be be a crutch to explain why I am failing at my life. 

It means alot to me that I am typing this currently, it comes from deep in the soul and I belive it is how I truley feel about things. My mind is the thing I treasure most in this world, it is the constant for the universe and if I ever were to lose it, I thiknk it would spell the end for the things I care about, not just meself... that can be acomplished easily enough. Peopl cou t on me for things that shoudl be acomfort but it isn't. Instead it presures me into thinking this way... this sort of unconcious fear of willing to have forward momentum. I am glad I can type so fst because whewn I couldn't aI had no place for these thoughts to got or escape. I feel this incessant pressure to release the trth of my soul, that only can happen at the speed of typing,  or speech but I feel it comess from a safer, deeper place swhen I type things out on a keyboard... even if I record myself alone speaking it feels that way. I think it comes from my pasdt/ history of typing in video galmes or online messaging with friends. It feels safer somehow, though I realize everyh key I pressi sprobably being logged somehwere by someone. 

My goal is to show this to someone I can trust with full propriety, without judgement and hopefully with some level of trust in the future of myself. Being that of a person who has intere3st in my getting better from this horriying state of being. Though I may seem okay in the normal way of speaking, I have cuase to belive lthat I am an outlier from society... I see things tath are probably best left unobserved, as far as the actions and evidence of peroples interactions are conceredned. I have at multiple times found myself regretting things that I said that were simple observations or seconedary actions whcih caused concern amongst my friends/cohorts. I am glad to be able to have observed th em because I have benefited from them in the past... but I fee

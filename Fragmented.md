First and foremost fuck your spelling and puncutation, it can be corrected later, you must let the thoughts flow then go back and fix them later. Secondly feel your emotions and let them flow here and be honest with yourself about them so that you have a full and thourough flow of inner dialouge. 

I am a broken man. A man nontheless... I have all my life felt like something was missing, I have trouble starting this thought simply due to the difficult nature of the questions it encompasses. First thing that comes to mind is the fact that I feel simultaneously that I worship a god that I dont belive in, yet part of me has the firm belief that there is no other way for our existence to be a thing. It feels like the only way and the least likely, it enfuriates me so. 

I have a problem with vice. I hate the station that is provided me, but feel that it would haunt me as a ghost haunts a trespasser. I need to figure out why I do not like the common state of mind that I enjoy on a daily basis, I feel asleep always... as if I have been and currently am a walking talking ghostg, followed by this informative tfact that I live and breath lies and disinformation about my station. I can change it but fors ome resson I chose not to, all that it would take is to journey past where ewe have been before. Either take a step forward or leave the world behind it makes no sense otherwise... yet here i STAND.

First and foremost fuck your spelling and puncutation, it can be corrected later, you must let the thoughts flow then go back and fix them later. Secondly feel your emotions and let them flow here and be honest with yourself about them so that you have a full and thourough flow of inner dialouge. 

I am a broken man. A man nontheless... I have all my life felt like something was missing, I have trouble starting this thought simply due to the difficult nature of the questions it encompasses. First thing that comes to mind is the fact that I feel simultaneously that I worship a god that I dont belive in, yet part of me has the firm belief that there is no other way for our existence to be a thing. It feels like the only way and the least likely, it enfuriates me so. 

I have a problem with vice. I hate the station that is provided me, but feel that it would haunt me as a ghost haunts a trespasser. I need to figure out why I do not like the common state of mind that I enjoy on a daily basis, I feel asleep always... as if I have been and currently am a walking talking ghostg, followed by this informative tfact that I live and breath lies and disinformation about my station. I can change it but fors ome resson I chose not to, all that it would take is to journey past where ewe have been before. Either take a step forward or leave the world behind it makes no sense otherwise... yet here i STAND. 

I am enfuritated by the world around me. I am subjected to the abso9lute torment of a wasted potential that I have had in my life. I feel like it could change at any momment but for some reason I cant figure out, I stay stagnant in my ways... other than accepting "god as my lord and savior" I have made no markable progres in the way that I view the world. AEven at that, some days I feel it is a lie I tell myself to keep from giving in entirely. If only I could go back and tell myself to continue your vicious progress towards whatever you deem necesary, the world would be ab teter place for it. I onlywish that this txt were going anywhere at all but I think it may fall on ears never to be heard. Ever person of potentiality has been faced with this wall of verisimilutde, these thoughts plague me as a locust plagues a swarm. I only wishe someone would come and fix me.

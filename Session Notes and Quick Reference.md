<span style="color:#ff0000">MAIN QUEST</span>: <span style="color:#c00000">Aorta</span> is negotiating a deal between the party and an anonymous buyer (The Consortium.  
 
<span style="color:#00b050">The Consortium</span> are looking for a new location to invest their hard earned wealth in. For some reason the location that they have in mind is an decrepit castle to the far north of Opportunity off in an area lost inside the maze of The Obsidian Peak. ***They have the blueprints for a the same weapon that the Stygian Forest used on Elysia.  

The Consortium's reason for surveying the land is somewhat of a trick. They are interested in the lands surrounding the fissure but know that something lingers here. But they don't want their contractor to find out because it will save them gold.

<span style="color:#c00000">Aorta</span>'s Workshop (In the Fleshcrafter's Guild area of Opportunity)
"Where did I leave my Aorta" or "<span style="color:#c00000">Aorta</span>" - A squelching mass of arms, the thing known as Aorta has a pinkish red hue allover its bodies various and numbered joints. Ligaments, arteries, fingers, mouths, tongues and the end and beginning of this creature is held in question. Eventually they seem to open the central cavity and a short cylindrical web of muscle fibers, tendons and nerve endings lead up to a globe of eyes. Some darting, some scanning, some staring... all manner of beast, fish, man and even some you don't recognize seem to look through you. 

You hear a rhythmic undulation around you begin as you hear in <span style="color:#ffc000">syncopated speech</span> <span style="color:#7030a0">"Welcome to my Workshop dearies."</span> It takes a moment but you realize on the outside of their central cavity is a scattering of mouths each placed in a different orientation. Their lips move and they speak a single chord with a note of each octave, but corrupt like an record player at the bottom of a well. 

*<span style="color:#c00000"> *Personality: A chaotic pragmatist who plays favorites, genuinely disgusted by playing it safe in any way. Greedy but only until she makes you upset.* </span>

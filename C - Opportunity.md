Ligaments, arteries, fingers, mouths, tongues and the end and beginning of this creature is held in question. Eventually they seem to open the central cavity and a short cylindrical web of muscle fibers, tendons and nerve endings lead up to a globe of eyes. Some darting, some scanning, some staring... all manner of beast, fish, man and even some you don't recognize seem to look through you. 
	You hear a rhythmic undulation around you begin as you hear in <span style="color:#ffc000">syncopated speech</span> <span style="color:#7030a0">"Welcome to my Workshop dearies."</span> It takes a moment but you realize on the outside of their central cavity is a scattering of mouths each placed in a different orientation. Their lips move and they speak a single chord with a note of each octave, but corrupt like an record player at the bottom of a well. 
	*<span style="color:#c00000"> *Personality: A chaotic pragmatist who plays favorites, genuinely disgusted by playing it safe in any way. Greedy but only until she makes you upset.* </span>

The consortium maintains a legitimate business in Opportunity where they run a kind of magic shop, book store and alchemist. The shop is ran by one Jedediah Narrowfeather, father of a local political dissonant, Drake Narrowfeather who leads the peoples Republic of Opportunity.

<span style="color:#c00000">Aorta</span>'s Workshop 
"Where did I leave my Aorta" or "<span style="color:#c00000">Aorta</span>" - A squelching mass of arms, the thing known as Aorta has a pinkish red hue allover its bodies various and numbered joints. Ligaments, arteries, fingers, mouths, tongues and the end and beginning of this creature is held in question. Eventually they seem to open the central cavity and a short cylindrical web of muscle fibers, tendons and nerve endings lead up to a globe of eyes. Some darting, some scanning, some staring... all manner of beast, fish, man and even some you don't recognize seem to look through you. 

You hear a rhythmic undulation around you begin as you hear in <span style="color:#ffc000">syncopated speech</span> <span style="color:#7030a0">"Welcome to my Workshop dearies."</span> It takes a moment but you realize on the outside of their central cavity is a scattering of mouths each placed in a different orientation. Their lips move and they speak a single chord with a note of each octave, but corrupt like an record player at the bottom of a well.

Today is the first day I'm writing in this (10/19/22), not sure if its temporary to get through hard times or permanent to help me in some other way I don't really understand yet. My idea and methods will change over time but there are a few ground rules I want to set right now.

I hope to keep these short (a few paragraphs max) to not burn myself out of writing or at least of this journal.

**This will not be like my other projects, I will talk pragmatically about the problems that I face, or at least the ones talked about here, and I will try my best to maintain a positive outlook on life through this writing.**

**Lastly, this will always be a private journal, full stop. I can talk about things written here, but no-one can ever see this due to its sensitive subjects.**

**_10/19/22_**

Today was not an easy day, firstly it was unforgivingly cold, secondly I was stuck outside in the dirt for the entire day laying underground pipe for my job at the current job site Pine Hill trailers (aka Freedomland Properties) in Gap. It wouldn't have been an exceptionally difficult day due to the pacing of it, nothing I haven't seen before. That was until around an hour and a half before wrapping up for the day. I climbed out of the 6ft trench that we were working in and as I was trying to cross to the other side when I landed on the other side of the trench the earth gave out under my right leg and I struck the edge of the ground hard on the front of my right thigh. So far the pain has been borderline unbearable, especially when first moving after staying still for a while. I was worried so I spoke with the foreman (Daryl Bowman) about the incident, I told him I was hopeful but he told me to talk to him tomorrow about it and he mentioned workers comp... I am extremely worried by this because from what I've heard there is a habit of firing employees if they even mention such things.

  

Then I go pick up some groceries, hobbling my way about the store and when I get home I am struck with an assault of words about Mom's day, supposedly her electric blanket almost started a fire, and supposedly that is my fault somehow. We continue talking and I eventually reveal the fact that I had a difficult day, and that I fell. "Oh here we go again" she states loudly... she blames me for this somehow, an accident that was entirely not my fault she blames me for and offers no consolation or even a worried question of are you ok. Later she states her ingratitude by listing the things that we didn't get from our grocery order. She then states that she wasn't going to cook dinner since I treated her in a way that she felt was rude, honestly I have no fucking idea what I did wrong besides getting hurt. She is finally driven to malicious hatred levels of anger by me saying that if she doesn't cook I'm moving out. Maybe I should... finally.

  

This last event is a perfect example of why I want to be free of her. She acts like she works a real job when all she does is stay home and take care of the minor duties required of her; Cleaning (on rare fucking occasion), taking care of the dogs (this is a true service), and do dishes sometimes. Every other waking moment she spends doing exactly what she fucking wants, even though she claims to not be able to due to one of her many many many hypochondria induced sicknesses or ailments. I hurts me so much to see her going through this crisis of personality, answered by a consistent state of fear and anger towards those who only mean her well. The former group includes me and anyone else she hasn't pushed away from her by refusing to change, be self reliant or even try to do something constructive with her life. My consistent nudging to maker her life more fulfilling and meaningful falls on deaf ears at best and met with anger every other time (which is most times). I can't imagine how frustrating it must be for her to see me building a future that she will most likely have no part in (at least in her mind).

  

It's clear, I need to figure out a way to make her better. My anger for her is simply on her futures behalf. Surely she can't be incapable of change. It may take a week, a month, or even years... but I will not stop trying to cure her of her self imposed limits, eventually I will learn how or keep throwing stuff and see what sticks.

**_01/07/23_**

I have failed in my initial hope in setting out on this Journal for it to be daily or weekly. I have written down things and discarded them like so much trash, pointless to think about at this point. Today is a better day than the last recorded entry to be sure. I decided to start an adventure in the Dungeons and Dragons world again, to hopefully wake my creative mind from the slumber of a new demanding career. For too long I have rested my thoughts, they must create something again. Part of this will probably get imported into my notebook for the campaign when I begin.

  

At the current moment I am unsure if it will be in person (unlikely) or online again. There are pros and cons to both, i'll lay them out here along with some minor seeds of worldbuilding that will shape how this construction is formed and faced. Online lends to more comfort and less demand on my time and costs. In person may give me an ability to know more people in real life as well as likely being a new experience and likely more involving while participating ad DM. Upon concluding these facts I will do as follows; Ask to the interest of my friend group and possibly their extended friends/family. If the gathered group is less than 3 players I will consider in person games, with some online games with the same group. Otherwise I will ask all involved in the recruiting process if they would be ok with online games still, to further develop our friendship in real life. After this I will gather the rest from an LFG post on reddit or my old player groups.

  

As for the world and its parts, my thoughts are this. when entertaining the idea of a world you must consider the following things. Time (age and technologies), Themes (funny, serious, sad), Interaction level (servants of the king, or a serf's protectorate), Stakes (the expected and actual price of failure) and lastly any personal goals you have for the setting.

  

Overview - I am thinking this setting as being inspired by a setting on a old Rollplay show called Court of Swords, specifically the place called The Court of the Void. The culture and time setting will be different but the concepts of vein hunters, and cities built secretly on top of large ones. The settings best part will come when the party learns of the second part of the setting, they are in a different plane and the overworld exists (probably hint with an object made of a material only in the overworld). They will uncover a hidden mystery and why the two planes were created (main story seed).

Time - I think I want this to be outside of normal fantasy settings with some allegorical connections to pop culture and history. A dark perverse place haunted by demons of the past and present, feelings of an ultimate evil obscured by time.

Themes - This will be an anxious, dark, regal one with momentary parts horror and mischief or frivolity.

Interaction Level - I will likely play this by ear, start out small as a local actor and possibly introduce bigger characters over time.

Stakes - This will largely play off of interaction level and player interest (combat, lore, loot)

Personal Goals - I want this to be equal parts challenging and self indulging for me. An opportunity to meet different types of people and let there stories form my future and current ones. Hopefully we can find some people who care about this as much as I can when in the deep end of world building and roleplaying.

  

I need to keep in mind what lost peoples interest in the previous games I played and ran, insist on consistency and the creativity of my players. I would like to keep using the goals system but I will poll the players on it before deciding for certain. I feel that I want to include parts of my previous worlds, but fear that may cause this to be the same as the old ones were, not necessarily bad but a bit boring at times largely due to player interaction with side interests. To avoid this, the side interests should become the main interests of the metaphorical camera of play... self indulgence can be done on the main campaign and with secrets bot PC related and lore related.

  

Now that I feel a solid inspiration coming on, time to go write a world into existence.

05/04/23

Today marks 4 weeks since my last day at Clark Inc. I had no idea I was going to be laid off but it happened nonetheless. Don (my boss) called me as I was picking up dinner for Friday and Saturday night in the form of pizza from Allessio's in Gap. He claims that due to permits and other random bullshit he probably made up to make me passive I wouldn't be working the first day back that I thought I was. This wasn't a big deal at first because I thought it was one day. It was Easter weekend, he calls me on the following Monday afternoon around 3 and tells me that I am being laid off, last date of employment being the Thursday before Easter 2023.

  

At first I was kind of relieved that I wouldn't have to go to work for a week, look at it as an unpaid vacation I thought... Two weeks passed and I called him about it. According to him a bunch of other Clark employees, mainly other helpers and employees that weren't there for a long time. This led to me at first denying it was happening, eventually realizing that it may take longer to get back to work than money I have saved up to pay bills with. All in all a very fucking terrible few weeks.

  

I'm confronted with emotions I haven't felt before, or at least in a long time. Almost instantly I lost that self assuredness I knew myself so well by, I think I may have suffered a mental break. I was picturing a future in which I go to school for 4 years and maybe stay employed with Clark for up to ten and then this happens literally out of the blue, no warning, no apologies really just an inordinate amount of "not my fucking problem" coming from the direction of my boss, a person I was supposed to respect and maybe even look up to in a way.

  

I keep having to remind myself that it will get better eventually. My mental state is very poor and I no longer feel myself or at least I think that's what is happening because I am almost unable to comprehend my own drives or emotions ever since I realized that I no longer had my career that I worked my ass off to maintain and learn. All I am left with is a slightly better understanding of how to put up with being treated like a slave, how to respect without being respected and give with out being gifted. On top of all of this I had to stop smoking thc, at first due to money but now due to needing to be clean for finding a new job... possibly even later than that depending on which job I get. The world is in such a state, and its about to get worse. I fear that I am not enough to face the coming days, weeks, years. I am drawn back to fonder times, but the memories are tarnished and taste like ash. I am tempted to create things, but noone will care to see it. I'm sure i'll get through it. But man its gonna fucking suck.

  

Below are a list of changes that must be made or solutions that must be obtained.

Find employment, learn how to relax without thc, find something new that makes me feel useful, pass your drug test

  

Writing doesn't seem to be helping me like it usually does, so bye I guess.

  

So long and thanks for all the fish.

So I  didn't kill myself, suprise!!! (Was it worth it?)

  

The drug test for this job turned out not to include THC and marijuana. My relationship with suicide has changed as a result of this. It seems that god does in fact exist, I refuse to relive that he does not see us as we are from this altercation. The day after I wrote about

  

Just when things seem to the worst they get even worse than though possible. But on the bright side, as sinful as it may be I have alcohol now in the form of a handle of 101 Wild Turkey. "Otterbase" called me telling me that my temp job was more temporary than I had thought. My official first day was May 29th 2023. It went terribly, It serves as being a great example of jobs to quit immediately or serves as being an example of the opposite of what it is willing to strive for.

  

On my first week I had so little focus on what would be my actual job that I had so little to talk about as a job description I thought my litteral job was to make some maintenance department lead (name of Dennis something or other) look good. The whole thing turned out to be a corporate experiment gone bad. A fully automated warehouse for frozen goods that had very little precedent, I was fired for some bullshit reason. Seemingly as many many were before me I am found without job and task.

  

Otterbase told me I was let go for a need for more supervision than expected, not going against my employment opportunities at all but being fired nonetheless. I am left in much the same spot as before, destitute without future or possibility. Time to find my own way to be in my future, otherwise there is no future.

  

The job itself wasn't so bad, follow computerized error codes to physical problems in their fully autonomous frozen warehouse. This means conveyors and optical sensors will have to be checked on, and I will secondhandedly gain full experience with warehouse computer systems (WCS). But most of all the job was about learning the shortcomings of an industrial ice manufacturing machine assembly. Altogether not so bad, but I was fired for work that was not my own.

  

My coworker Ryan would consistently take smoke breaks while we were working on outside tasks, claiming it an osha responsible task to take 15 minute break for every 15 minutes worked. I found this hyperbolic and so I took a break but not near as much. Perhaps this was a test for my last day, maybe this is what it took for me to get fired, but I will never know because the only reason given for my termination was needing too much supervision, which I would consider  a normal reason, considering how faulty and useless the hiring and firing manager seemed to be. All in all i'm glad with how things turned out, I just wish there was more of a reason to fire me, I was a good employee, and tried my very best. If they can't see that then that is their loss.

  

I have come to realize that this future of job searching may be leading me to an alternative (and clean) lifestyle because I have to be without my long formed habit of smoking THC. It's uncomfortable and overall just sucks but I have a small feeling (obtained from my previous struggles without THC) that I may not need it as much as I once thought. THC in itself offers no addictive qualities as I once thought. The only pressure that I have had is purely subjective and behavioral, besides that some slight lung and heart health issues I have had whilst smoking, but the second I quit the chemical side of those stopped. The only pressure being purely habitual and mental.

  

The following days and weeks will be a test of not only my lack of THC but also if I am able to find a new source of income. At this point I'm hesitant to abstain from any source of employment, now that I don't really have the skill or history to turn down non-useful experience opportunities.

  

You see yourself as an alternate to the heroes presented by modern culture.  A sort of ceramic hero that wants to be all that the heroes represent (capability, breadth of hatred, and history that none can atone to because it is imagined from what you picture yourself to be as a man. No matter how happy or represented you may feel from a character they will lack that altruistic, unconfirmed version that you are looking for.

  

All that is required of you is to be the best that you know how to be.

Smoking, Drinking and all other aspects of sin be damned, you know how to best achieve the goals that you must. All the rest of your ambitions come after being a god fearing, good role model for those around you to aspire to achieve. Every step of who you are deserves and should be similar to god and his tribulations.

  

It seems so Ironic to me right now that about 5 months ago I was worried about an imaginary world that only I knew about, maybe tis some sort of evangelical sign of where I should be. God forgive me and be there for my next ventures, I know I shall require all aids that come to me.

My Thoughts on THC and additional chemical compounds.

  

I am slowly realizing that THC and its compounds lead to an extremely emotionally addictive decision making process of (you are therefor it is good) mentality. In my experience I have found it to be beneficial for most people at first, until you realize it is changing the way that you think of things permanently. It has no effect on my personal hand eye coordination but an excelling effect on my memory recall and my attention to detail when it comes to remembering rudimentary things or things that don't necessarily need remembered often.

  

To have belonged to something and no longer belonging to it, trust me in saying it is a very painful experience, having no acknowledgement prior to. The pain of having thought of a concept to be your very own way of conceiving the universe and then later to have it be a lie is a very painful idea indeed. THC leads you to believe that the thing you are doing is the most interesting thing you (as a person) CAN BE doing in the moment without alternative. It can be useful for this, because some people (like me) have this on record as being their first time seeing anything they have done as being worthwhile. Meaning that it is dangerous to take it away from the person who may be recommending these unethical drugs, as they may have at this point derived a sense of self worth from other people trying these temporary enhancements as full on experience enhancers. There is a time and a place for this type of thing, but daily habitual use is not one of them.

  

I have had a love hate relationship with THC and its alternatives. It makes me feel calm and understood, while making me seem unconscionable and untrustworthy. It makes me believe that my thoughts while not on it are not useful, and unnoticed while the opposite is true, but most often a lack of social tact and overall feeling, derived from my lack of social knowledge have been experienced.

  

One thing is certain, the people around me view me as a library of knowledge on the subject and this alone is enough to drive me from being that. Perhaps I have strayed too far in the darkness. God might not want this for me and mine.

There and Back Again

  

The initial job search has been going worse than I had hoped. Out of 40 or so applications only about 15 got back to me, mostly very distant (30 minute drive), not paying enough and overall just not great jobs to have. I interviewed at Groff's Heating, A/C and Electrical for a job as an Electrical Apprentice. I had high hopes about the job because they were the first call back that I got on Monday morning following the impromptu job search on Friday. The interview went amazingly, but they emailed me this morning informing me that there had been better candidates. I also registered at a temp agency ---- CONT 07/09/23 ---

"A troubled time in my life"

  

Still unemployed two weeks and then some after my initial release from Americold I come today bringing tidings of both ill and amazing good.

  

First the good. Today I was baptised... for the first time as far as I am aware. It happened at Mt. Zion United Methodist Church in Narvon, at around 11am. I feel bad about my previous thoughts, feelings and conversations regarding religion. I have crossed the part of my understanding where I went from feeling like I knew everything there is to know about the subject to realizing there is so much more to learn both about God and this grand story we have been repeating and repeating since before the dates switched from B.C. to A.D. . There is some greater significance to the whole thing that I was blind to before, it feels right in my bones if that makes any sense at all.

On my way home I had the strange feeling that I so often do after church. A sort of reflection of the mind projected into the world around me, seeing nature and its beauty as a creation of god and my perception of it and extension of that gift. A big part of me is wanting to qualify all of this with something I used to tell myself about allowing myself to believe in something. That if it allows me to become a better person, and promotes personal growth in any way that it can't be a bad thing entirely. I am now realizing this to be a dormant part of my mind, a sort of self reliance on what it is to be human and all the dirt, darkness and humility that comes with it. I believe that this is a profound step for my future, for better or worse I am now a "Son of God".

  

Now the bad. Two weeks... before I've had points in my life where that seemed to fly by, but this has been a cripplingly slow crawl to the pictured finish line of a place of employment. I have prayed time and again, asked for those around me to pray for me and done everything in my power, both physically and spiritually to prepare and procure a job for myself. There are two opportunities that I am hopeful about, one is a job in New Holland as a "Upfitter" for emergency service vehicles at a place called 10-8 emergency services. I think that the job would suit me but ultimately it wouldn't give me meaningful job experience that I desperately need at this point in my life. It has been a week (albeit a summer holiday week) without any confirmation short of a return phone call saying I was "still in the running". This doesn't spark confidence in me but the second opportunity did. A retirement community near Lancaster named Willow Valley has a job opening for a Maintenance position. There are so many things about the job that seem perfect it's almost to good to be true. The big negative is that the pay isn't amazing (20/hr), but the schedule, job duties and culture all seem to be a perfect fit. Some of the main things I can see myself enjoying are that it is largely self driven after the training is over, short of taking work orders and working as a overall team of course. Secondly the job is in a retirement community meaning that I will be working in service to the elderly residents, and my glean some wisdom from them. My mom even made the very good point that this could be an opportunity for me to meet a good woman, and I can't disagree seeing as during my tour of the facility the person I was with was able to kiss his wife at a security gate. I just hope to God I am not wasting my time thinking about a future with this company like I did with Clark and Americold.

A Driving Force

  

I must admit it has been a long time since I felt this sense of simultaneous despair and overwhelming will to live. I think it has a lot to do with all of the major life changes that have been happening in my life recently. I fear that I am using my circumstances and taking the wrong advice, but then fear I am not taking valuable advice when it is given. My thoughts are so clouded with conflict that the words I have written today have been spilling out like a overflowing cup. I suppose it's better than the alternative that I experience frequently.

Its a truly terrifying experience to actualize the knowledge that everyone around you has a life just as complex *if not more* than yours. To imagine the pain of my father, mother and everyone who came before them and led to me. I feel worthless one second and like absolute gold the next. To be quite honest I am a total mess, that seems completely fine from the outside... though I am beginning to think that people are starting to notice.

  

Last Saturday I went to Lancaster Cigar Bar at the request of my friends Zach and Andrew, I drank too much and smoked about the same. So often when I am with friends I find myself coming out of my shell more and more, opening up and piecing together why I think about things the way that I do, and what that means to me and the people in my life. Part of me wants to believe that they actually do care about me, evidenced by the care that my friends took when I explained my qualms about my career choices and the prospective futures that I imagine for myself. But the other part of me, in my mind the same part that chose to be baptised today wants to become a force of positive change in those around me and live the way that God intended (He is a good role model after all).

  

When I think of the major changes in my life and what I consider to be the "Epochs" of my life they usually boil down to the following timelines.

**Innocent and Intangible** (1997-2005)

**Naive and Curious** (2005-2010)

**Morbid Inquisition** (2010-2017) aka. "Past Me"

**Banal Partiality** (2018-2021)

**Ignorant Enlightenment** (2022-Present?)

Internal Conflict and a Time of Great Decision

  

In the past couple weeks I have been presented with a few opportunities for further employment. The days crawl by with unending sorrow and stress, making me realize the ease of my full year at Clark on the daily. Luckily I had a job interview at a place called TE Connectivity in Manheim, PA for a position as a maintenance mechanic. They are a facility that produces small metal parts for a large number of studious companies... namely the US Military and Boeing aerodynamics. I feel honored to say that within a day they contacted the temp agency that I was with, saying they wanted me to fill the position (following the interview that I had on 7/13/23). I am left waiting for the job I (after a long internal debate) decided would fit me best, which is Willow Valley, providing that they get back to me about the job opening that they have for Willow Valley.

  

**I was baptised last Sunday**, forgot to mention that. It felt special, as if I was starting a new era of my life (whatever that might mean). Deep inside I still have the same internal struggle as I have always had... Is my faith a predication of my actual internal moral and spiritual compass or is it something more sinister and driven by those around me. I truly want to believe in God, so much so that I find myself a zealot when opposition is found. I want Him to be the answer I have been seeking, but part of me still clings to the little control that I think I have left over my own separate action and thought.

  

Nature has so much in the way of natural order and hierarchy that I find it increasingly difficult to believe in anything but a higher power. Even man is so driven by what we now "know" as chemical desire (i.e. drugs and alcohol) that it seems impossible for faith to have a place in the spaces of modern sensibility. Today at church they spoke on how we can expand our ministry, benefitting those who may not feel comfortable in a space like a church or a invitational organized by the church body.

  

To me, my relationship with God was only *formalized* through attendance at a church. Meaning I feel that I made the spiritual decision before the physical one. Though I may be a sinner, even at some points an unrepentant (though temporarily) sinner, I still find myself living with a mindset ordained by Christianity. I find myself questioning if our version of the accepted Christianity is the "Historically correct" one. Faith is a big part of the modern church, so much more than that of the post modern (1950+) church. The plethora of information and studies that are at our fingertips as a populace reminds us that we all come from somewhere, and our mindset may be just as flawed as those we left to antiquity. No matter what it all seems to come back to a valley in Israel around 0-1 AD.

  

*** During a pause in the writing of this last paragraph I believe I experienced a sign. A wooden carving of an eagle I had set (for many months) on the entertainment center in my room fell inexplicably. The floor doesn't move enough to cause it to fall, the wind isn't really a factor since it is on the second floor. Lastly and most definitively it got knocked down as I was nearly halfway across the room I was walking into. It's this such as this that make me believe in the Trinity. It's terrifying to admit but I believe that God is real.***

  

Anyway, I have decided that I will hold out as long as is needed at the current position for TE Connectivity, hoping for a career with Willow Valley retirement community.

Realization about drugs and alcohol

  

Lets talk about Alcohol first why don't we. In the past it has been a true friend, warm and inviting in times of need. Mainly through the tides of COVID and my uncomfortable bouts of depression following my departure from Clark and even now as I am writing this. I realize it isn't a "friend" in the common sense of the term, but still it allows me the space to think of things that I would rather while I find myself in times of struggle and stress.

  

So far the only negative effects have been the following: Hangovers suck ass, going to the gym after drinking typically leads me to having lots and lots of cramps, drinking while in public makes me say things I wish I wouldn't have, My thoughts come with less of a filter when conveying verbal ideas and lastly if I get extremely drunk I start thinking about missed opportunities in the past... no. Rather opportunities that I wish I could have lived forever inside of. Namely my experiences on the Recrafted Civilizations Minecraft server, my interactions with past teachers and school activities (namely musical circa 2015,2016), Rollplay (the itmejp You-tube channel multi series), my previous ttrpg game (Secrets of Ebbon) and last certianly not least my interactions with my father and his friends.

  

The Negative Experiences: It is a thirsty supporter, someone who would rather have more of themselves than empower the creation of life without the substance. Simply a self driven narrative of protagonism, making me feel good about the things that I have been able to achieve in the time that I live in. A very simple form of self neglect that is self perpetuating, thus why is is nearly as old as humanity itself.

  

  

Common Retrospectives (while drinking): In hopes to forgive/forget about things that may have happened while I was under the jurisdiction of alcohol, I will list them by order of frequency that they come up in my mind. This may allow me to make room for other things and produce closure for the things I lack closure for. This is not a space to gush about the past, or a place to blame others for my shortcomings. I know how much I may have screwed up, but since I am coming forward it means more that I do that instead of living with undisclosed regrets.

**Recrafted Civilizations Minecraft server:** Recrafted Civilizations was an important period of my life. I showed myself different cultures of people who were my age, and learned on how to best adapt myself for who I envisioned myself to be. It was a historical Minecraft Roleplay server, centered around European rulers from 1300-1400 mainly. In the most recent installment I was a part (2020 mainly during COVID) I played as the nation of Sweden. It was not a wholly historically accurate version of what happened, but I got the chance to play with a very large amount of players who really (and I mean REALLY) cared about the things that they were doing in game. I along side them played a faithfully recreated version of King Gustav the Third of Sweden. This extended so far as selling property to brewing and trading companies in Stockholm and making alliances with Prussia and England in the event of Russian takeover/power transfer. Everyone cared so much on this server, entire chapters of actions were published to the servers public forum, but a fact that is often forgotten is how it was a complete cash grab by iZedman and Gnomega (the two main owners of the server). Every 6-10 months the server would be killed, then revived with the intent of creating a new interest only a few decades of history later.

Honestly it was an amazing idea, I had so much fun with the previous recreations of "Recrafted" that I was shocked when people stopped playing for "no reason". But I was blind to the fact that the only admins responsible for running day to day occurrences on the server were abused by the owners of the server, that never even bothered with the server that they supposedly were "running".

  

The server gave me so much time and room for growth. I probably spent nearly 1000 hours of diplomacy, drafting of political documents and roleplaying on the last version of Recrafted. When the overall consensus was the owners/admins didn't care about the general player base I nearly lose my mind. Being as it was so close to the end of COVID I lucked out, only having a few months before I went back to Hershey Farm Inn full time, I found single-player games and various long form content(s) to fill the void of unproductivity that it had caused in my life.

  

For nearly 2 months Recrafted was all I did, played or read/researched. When it failed less than a week after my departure, a very large amount of people lost all of their builds and hard work due to the server owners petty disallowance of their "premium map" being unreleasable so we couldn't revisit or reuse our builds in a single player world or in any form, the player-built map was totally lost as far as the previous player-base was concerned.

  

Since there has been a mention of a revival, but then due to "lack of interest" I imagine it wasn't followed through. All domains and addresses tied to the server as far as I can find are 404'ed or dead links. Maybe its best we all move forward and learn that we can't trust just anyone with a community we spend so much of our time in.

  

I think it hurts me so much because of how much time, effort and feeling I spent creating a kingdom, allies and a city worth being proud of... only for it to be stripped away from me for no fault of my own.

  

I can move forward knowing that it wasn't my fault, and I was a victim of a long running community of abuse administrative abuse and personal selectivity among past players.

Interactions with past teachers/school activities(namely musical era 2015-2016):

  

**Rollplay:** For a very long time at least in my perspective (2017-2021) in my all of my spare time (be-it at work, commuting, showering, excersising or otherwise) I listened to a tabletop roleplaying game "channel" named Rollplay, fronted by producer/player ITMEJP. It lasted me so long, through every time in my life from then till now basically, only stopping when one of their Dungeon Masters made some incorrect assumptions about player choice, regarding consent. His name was Adam Koebel (Designer of Dungeon World) and he taught me everything I know about being a Dungeon Master (with some help from Matt Coleville). There were a few exceptions with Rollplay: Blades which was DM'ed by the creator of the game John Harper, and a fair few occurrences from other DM's for Rollplay Stephen Lumpkin and Ryan Moore.

  

I have seen everything Rollplay has to offer, even a large majority of the ancillary (post show/patreon) content, Everything about it I loved up to and including the choices of Adam in the episode that got him "cancelled". While I believe this to be a selective cancelling, I truly believe that it wasn't his intent to stop making ttrpg (tabletop roleplaying game) content. He was such a brilliant mind that I find him fascinating and inspiring for my own D&D content. Just the Rollplay series Court of Swords inspired two of my setting ideas, both Secrets of Ebbon (First D&D Campaign) and a campaign that I am currently on hiatus from recruiting for (inspired by Court of the Void). It sort of corresponds to how I view modern day politics and occurrences. No matter what someone will find a "major issue" with something that you love or enjoy.

  

To this day I am unable to find enjoyment out of ITMEJP's content, simply due to the irrepsponsive aftertaste I get... Whenever I watch his content I remember how quickly he dropped his years-long friend/business partner in favor of maintaining what makes the people happy. I will be honest, the recent (2020) controversy with Kaitlyn lends no credence, due to how she acted on Rollplay: Mirror Shades. The whole treatment of Adam Koebel, It's disgusting and in opposition of art, much to the demise of ITMEJP's recent attempts to recreate a roleplaying community with ThatBronzeGirl, It screams "I just want what is woke right now", and I refuse to stand alongside it.

  

I currently stand aside on the issue, longing for the times when Kovacs fell down the stairs, or when Gideon stepped on Wester's neck. Maybe those are long gone, but I want them to be relived in my own way, with or without the Rollplay name continuing.

  

**Secrets of Ebbon**: As a creative person, this stands as one of the most important times in my life. It was the first time my creativity was fully accepted for all its worth, the first time people actually appreciated what I had accomplished in my making of the world that they were playing in. For nearly a year I was a god of a world that was inhabited by 4-6 players of varying "buy-in". Every step of it felt entirely real to me, in its own separate world but totally actualized by my able imagination. I wrote pregame summaries that I voiced over for nearly 6 months. Came up with interesting new ideas of a D&D setting for a whole year and altogether just crushed the fuck out of making a realistic progressing power struggle of a D&D campaign. The thing that tore us apart in the end was infighting and conflicting schedules.

  

When I think of SoE it is usually in a bittersweet reminiscence of how things went. I wish they (the players) had the possibility of realizing the full consequences of their actions(in game). Our group got torn apart by peoples lives starting (college and oncoming nonnegotiable adult responsibility). The events that went well, went so well that I couldn't possibly have planned them as a DM. And the events that didn't really go as planned were usually a new fun experience for all involved. I only wish that schedules panned out more fairly, and that I would have showed my players more patience. The age group of the players I was dealing with was essentially pre-life changing decisions and I was in a similar stage in my life. I wouldn't change any thing except for how I let it fizzle out near the end. Maybe I should try and get the players interested in a new era of SoE, or maybe I should just move on... obviously, this is the least certain of my memories.

  

Something has told me to write a welcoming/request to join message for a reunion of the Secrets of Ebbon cast. Probably the alcohol... Read after sober.

  

@Everyone

Hello, I've missed you all. I am inviting all of you ( to a session 0.1). We have obviously lost contact after such a long time since "real life" decided it had some things to do. The Secrets of Ebbon still maintain their obscurity. Though time has elapsed you will be free to reprise your original role, or create new characters to find the new territories of the many Faces of power. Natalya has invited you back to her stronghold at Voidhope Citadel, after a strong magical disaster near Kaln she has decided to call in all possible allies... at a significant cost.

  

I have posted a @everyone to my old Secrets of Ebbon server, time will tell who repsonds, I may reach out to people who have left the server to see if they are interested in what the future has to say for SoE.

  

Brett (Wolfsbane) has posted some recent dms that I wish to respond to:

I'm proud of you for getting through your first year as easily as you have, I wish I lived near you so I could play drums for your band, I'm happy you got a summer job, those are important (not just for the money). I haven't heard from anyone from Secrets of Ebbon since our last session😞 but I hope to hear back from a couple of you guys at least. If  you could let Sam know we are (hopefully) starting SoE again for at least a few sessions that would be wonderful. I haven't been a great friend I know but I hope to remedy now and in the future <3  . Let me know if you would be able to fit D&D in your busy schedule sometime ;)  .

  

ChillinVulpix (vinnie): Hey I know we haven't talked in a while but I hope this message finds you well. I just wanted to reach out before I post a general call, I was thinking about restarting Secrets of Ebbon. How do you feel about this... how have you been, honestly I have been worried about you and hope this message finds you in a better state than you were in when we last spoke. If not then feel free to talk to me still, I'm here for ya however I can be🙂

  

The Positives of Alcohol

I probably wouldn't have written any of the above statements about my life if not induced by alcohol/THC.

  

In general I feel the thoughts and memories that I make while drinking (in some cases copious amounts) of alcohol are mostly about previous experiences and different sources of love that I feel I have lost during my life on this earth. I am scared that the only time I am truly retrospective (on events that are meaningful to me) are when I am drunk.

A Good Time to Reflect

  

I need to make a "hard and fast" rule about contacting people from my past while impaired, be it by drink or otherwise my mind seems to lack tact when I am in my cups. The previous events that were written about yesterday were useful, but ultimately I regret not taking more time to reflect on how the relationships of that D&D campaign felt when they ended. I should have been more selective with who I messaged. Overthinking isn't necessarily a bad thing when debating on messaging friends that you haven't seen or heard from in over a year. Ultimately it came from a good place emotionally, but if I do so in the future I risk ruining the image my old friends have of me due to my lack of tact and respectfulness when impaired.

  

Previously I mentioned that I viewed a couple of different periodical Epochs preceding or being caused by large events in my life. I hope to outline these epochs of experience so that I may glean information on how I developed into the person that I am today. Additionally it may lead to a deeper understanding of who I am, and help me remember that I am a good person.

  

**Innocent and Intangible** (1997-2005)

From birth until I was about 8 years old I have very little memory, I know that it was largely a non-traumatizing part of my life due to me being fairly fortunate when it comes to having a comfortable and enriching home life at that age. Things that I think helped me grow in this period of time were:

Mom and Dad encouraged me to be curious, in this stage it was largely reading and watching television. They fostered a highly literate and mature mindset in me from early on. So much so that most adults were surprised I was as young as I was at this age.

  

**Naive and Curious** (2005-2010)

Just after I started at Salisbury Elementary I feel that I had my "Awakening"... meaning when I started making decisions for myself, solving my own problems and most importantly I realized what my strengths and weaknesses were. The first few years (Kindergarten, 1st and most of 2nd grade) went with out event, I was slow to wake but once the fire was lit I started seeing things very differently, I used my size and intellectual superiority over my peers in detriment to my own life. I suffered from severe anger issues, disrespect for authority and was altogether an annoying little shit to anyone I didn't feel respected me, including teachers, fellow students, my principle and vice principle. In the end the thing that pulled me out of it happened in about 4th grade I think.

Due to my anger issues and disrespect for authority I had in school suspension a fair few amount of times for one reason or another. The last time I recall having it was when I got into a fight with another student, sticking up for myself and my friend after being called "the fat kids" during art class. I very nearly killed a student when I was walking past the person who insulted me he was leaning back in his chair... I grabbed the back of his chair as I was passing his desk and slammed it backwards towards the floor. He got sent home early for medical reasons and I felt genuinely bad after the fact.

During the suspension I met a boy who was very old for a 5th grader, I asked him multiple times if he was on a middle school trip as often happened the middle school kids would visit the elementary and read to the littler kids. I never saw this kid before or after but I remember the conversations we had that day. He was in 5th grade for the third time through, he seemed way too smart to actually require being held back that many times. He reminded me of myself, but I had a few years to correct these series of mistakes. He told me of how often he was in the suspension room, stating that he was in here more than any room in the building. I think what caused this to be an important moment in this part of my life was this was the first time I saw somebody his age acting like me, a person a few years younger than him. I believe this woke me up to the very real fact that I am in control of what happens to me, my failure is my own and is only caused by my lack of effort or emotional immaturity in the way that I dealt with negative emotions.

All through this era my father started to introduce firearms and hunting into my life. While I didn't hunt with him until I was around 11, I shot guns with him at the shooting range (New Holland Rod & Gun Club) nearly every week. I so looked forward to these outings that it felt like Christmas whenever Dad would come into my room on Sunday mornings and ask me to get up for breakfast and to go the range. Writing this now I realize it was his way of bonding with me after he was absent for a large part of my childhood on business in Maryland and Virginia for his fathers company. He took me through my understanding of the way we interact with nature, why we live the way we do and how to value the things we don't usually think about such as wildlife, firearm responsibility and the procedure of how to  approach entirely new things.

Once while hunting whitetail deer at "Old Man Wilson's farm" in Narvon my father let hold and shoot a high caliber rifle for the first time, a bolt action .308. We were walking back to our vehicle when I got pouty about not seeing anything to shoot while we were hunting, I believe it was the second day this happened that week. He saw me become upset and offered to let me shoot, warning me of the kick that this gun had compared to others that I had shot up to then. I didn't shoulder the rifle properly and it slipped off of my shoulder from the recoil, the scope hit my eye and left a funny looking ring shaped bruise. I was proud to show it off in school the following day.

My father taught me how to be proud of myself during this part of my life, making good shots with firearms, being rewarded for seeing things noone else sees and thinking before I act. I have a feeling that the introduction of sports and hunting in my life was the outlet that I required for my behavior to improve in and out of school. Mom supported his habits and appreciated (at least I think so) the much needed breaks that she got from being a full time mother.

After a lot of practice with hunting my dad finally bought me my own high caliber rifle, a 7mm-08 Browning A-Bolt. One of the first few times we went to the range to sight it in I was taking long shots (300 yards) and after the second shot I hit a golf ball that he jokingly put on a post near the backboard. He looked at me in a way I hadn't really experienced before, I now know this was most likely pride (I hope). He kept the golf ball in the gun cabinet and showed it off to his friends at work when it happened, I still have it and protect it because I see it as one of the first times my father was that proud of me.

My dad attempted putting me into sports and I enjoyed them for the most part. I joined a football team that had players almost 4 years older than me due to my weight disqualifying me from joining the teams that were my age group. The practices showed me my shortcomings in the cardio and determination department, probably becoming one of the first times I actually failed at something I tried to succeed in. The nail in the coffin for playing football was when I missed three consecutive weigh ins, the last only being over by a pound and a half. Even then they still didn't play me very much in the games that I was able to join. Eventually I got tired of being a benchwarmer and being berated by a coach that ended up leaving the district after that year, I joined baseball/basketball leagues associated with my school district.

Basketball was started at my request, the practices went well and I got along with most of the people on my team and my coaches. Most of the people in the team I ended up going to school with and being well liked by them, but ultimately it wasn't really the sport for me.

Baseball was something that I really enjoyed for a long time. I played from about 2004 all the way until I started high school. The first team I was on was tee ball, where I met one of my best friends Nick Detore, his grandpa and father were assistant coaches for the team. I played one or two years of normal league baseball and eventually due to my heavy hitting I tried out for a travel league. The travel league was where I met a lot of my friends/acquaintances that lasted me throughout my high school days. I played as catcher, and pinch hitter for the team, some left outfield later on in the season. Eventually my coach approached me and my parents, stating that the reason a lot of my teammates were on this team was so that they could join the high school team and maybe play for a college team eventually. This we later discovered was his way of saying "we are going to play you a lot less" because talent scouts for the high school team began watching the games. I hurt my Achilles tendon on my left foot shortly after this while running around bases following a homerun that I hit and it still hurts every now and then. I hold few hard feelings from this era, mainly the cliques of kids who planned on going into the high school teams. Danny Rosado was a good friend of mine throughout most of middle school, when we were celebrating our last games at a local ice cream stand he called me "fat-ass" in front of everyone for almost no reason and claimed he was glad I didn't get to play much because I sucked... this was objectively false as I had more RBI's than 90% of the team, so we grew apart... everyone makes mistakes, maybe I should reach out.

One of the first times I remember experiencing a forlorn feeling of the past is one day when we were living at our house on Wertztown Rd.. I had a habit during the summer of going outside and just hitting the ball around the yard, chasing after it time and time. One time I hit the ball so far it went deep into the woods and I couldn't find it after an hour of looking. This happened the summer after I graduated middle school I think, and after the travel league ended. I sat on the steps of the back porch and cried long and hard. I didn't know why, but now I know that I was grieving over the loss of my team. Looking back I know it was fine for me to feel this way, but I felt like a baby for it, so I hid my love for baseball and eventually grew out of it and my love for it turned into a love of reading, video games and playing the drums.

  

**Morbid Inquisition** (2010-2017) aka. "Past Me"

This particular period in my life is probably the most painful to talk about. It will probably end up being the longest of the "Epoch"s of my life as it housed the largest amount of catalytic moments of my life.

The Death of My Father

Richard Lee Heist, Jr., 52, of Paradise, died on Monday, September 23, 2013 as a result of an truck accident near Roanoke, VA. He was the beloved husband of Judy A. Hollinger Heist with whom he shared 20 years of marriage. Born in  Somerset, PA, he was the son of Richard Lee Heist Sr. of Somerset and the late Dolores Weimer Heist. 

Richard was employed by Schumaker Trucking.

He is survived, in addition to his wife and father, by one son Richard M. Heist at home, one stepdaughter; Amanda Daily of Narvon, three step grandchildren and two sisters Tammy Higgins of Alexandria, VA and Nancy Heist of Woodbridge, VA. He was preceded in death by  one brother Michael Heist and one stepdaughter Heather Daily.

  

The day before he left I helped him write and print multiple copies of a "trip sheet". He always had trouble with formatting in google docs and similar word processors, but I had no issue with helping him and did so excitedly. The following documents can be found on [rmh6055@gmail.com](mailto:rmh6055@gmail.com) 's google drive account... being that the format still exists when you are reading this (hopefully).

  

I wrote the above obituary two days after my fathers passing. It took me a very long time to realize who my father actually was. Like everyone else, he wasn't perfect... he made mistakes but to me he was a hero.

  

"There are many things that you do not wish to do in this life and one of them is having to lose someone that you love. He was my dad and I was not expecting this. This week has been the beginning of a change that will take the rest of my life. I will never forget you, I will just keep your memories beside along the journey. I will never forget the memories that I have made with [you.Weather](http://you.Weather) it be; Hunting, Riding motorcycles, and spending time with you. And I dread not being able to make more. All that I have to say is I love you and I will miss you. "

Above is an exact transcript of the prepared speech that I had leading up to the day of the funeral. I will list below what I remember saying, based on the fact that I was too emotional to go off of cues I spoke from the heart and delivered a very personal speech. I was told afterwards that the words I said would touch their hearts "forever" and I hope they were telling the truth because it may be the most true statement I have said.

"There are many things that you don't wish to have happen to you in this life, for me it was losing someone so close to you... He was my dad, and I wasn't expecting this. This week has been the beginning of a change that will take the rest of my life. I will never forget you, I will just keep the memories alongside the journey. I will never forget the memories that I have made with you. Weather it be hunting, riding motorcycles or spending time with you... I dread not being able to make more. All that I have to say is that this moment is like a blade being forged, this being the quenching bath after leaving the furnace of grief that this event has and will continue to be... All that I have to say is that I love you, and I will miss you. "

Below for reasons of posterity, are the tracks I prepared with my mother and sister for my fathers funeral "soundtrack" (In order)

With Your Love - Journey

Fade to Black - Metallica

Sweet Home Alabama -Lynyrd Skynyrd

I'm Already There - Lonestar

Faithfully - Journey

I've been watching you - Rodney Adkins

I Was Made For Lovin' You Baby - Kiss

Have You Ever Seen The Rain - Creedence Clearwater Revival

Far Away - Nickelback

Fortunate Son - Creedence Clearwater Revival

Chicken Fried - Zac Brown Band

Butterfly Kisses - Bob Carlisle

Back In Black - AC DC

(Everything I Do)I Do It For You - Journey

  

I underestimated just how difficult this was to record/write. I always knew it was a very difficult part of my life but I wasn't sure how detached I was from the events following. I was 16 years old when my father died. Ironically the same songs play quite often at weddings, family reunions and even at celebrations. It reminds me every step of the way, certain bands (namely CCR, Metallica, and Journey I keep on current playlists to this day). I hope he is up there listening, and that my listening to it brings me closer to him, it does in my heart at least. The last song I have accurate memory of lisenting to in his memory is Chicken Fried, as corny as it may be... it holds a special meaning to me and probably always will. I love you Dad.

  

I miss my father so fucking much that it hurts me physically to say it out loud, I am very glad I don't have to speak to record words here because I don't think I ever could otherwise. My father is an unending font of lessons, even if he didn't teach them to me himself I have found the capability to learn them postpartum, for better or for worse. Even today (07/23/23) I was literally incapable of exclaiming to my friends just how much I missed my father.

  

I may not be prepared to write this section of my life but I will try anyway, regardless of consequence. In chronological order...

Coming out of 2010 and until 2013 I was acclimating and adjusting to high school culture, It was much different than middle school, surely. The main differences were that the students received more leeway in the process of completing a task, for the better in most cases. On the few occasions that interactions with underclassmen happened it was usually an equal and happy experience... usually the environment led to the upperclassmen being much more stressed and tied down than the underclassmen meaning I was pretty much alone with the people of my graduating year.

  

I was performing under expectations, not focusing on the correct things for someone whos main job is being in school. I completed the minimum effort to not be failing any classes, and in classes that I cared about I tried my hardest: namely history, math and English. Now I realize what I was lacking was investment in the work I was producing. So much of my sense of failure can be attributed to a lack of understanding of what I should be understanding as important work. Everything I have witnessed leads me to believe that public school has that effect on people... and eventually my father died.

  

I was coming home from school on a Monday afternoon, wheeling the trash can in from the Sunday trash pickup, when I realized that my entire extended family was on my front porch. I immediately asked what was wrong, intuitively knowing that this doesn't usually happen. The first person I remember seeing was my sister, who led me to my mother and we all collectively convulsed and sobbed together... lamenting the unfortified death of the only man I had looked up to in my life. Turns out... my father had died the night before I went to school, and "people" thought it would be a good idea to wait until I went home to tell me. I don't remember my classes, barely what grade I was in... but what I do remember is the cries of my mother and myself. Like wounded animals we lamented the loss, crying without thought, feeling without thinking the grief poured over all of us like a waterfall on a speck of dust. I cannot find one person who was there that remembers what happened exactly during this event, I believe we all blocked it from our memory... we found it so traumatizing. But I remember,  it was an extremely extended period of  existential anguish. Nothing more. The pain radiates like Chernobyl, the memory still as real as the day all of it happened, yet still I can't find a single account that remembers the same events that I do.

  

The first memory I have after this is multiple days after. I sprang into action, determining myself as the most valid candidate to form my fathers obituary and funeral playlist. I have recorded the obit/playlist above before the recollection of the day of death. The process was therapeutic for me at the time. I think it was because it turned out to be the only thing I had control of during that time, though I believe that I probably shouldn't have been put on my shoulders as squarely as it was. I feel I did a stupendous job for a sophomore in high school, and would gladly write the same speech again, if in exclusion of the minor spelling and typos... but that is forgiven due to the circumstance.

  

I was slow to rejoin my friends at school, thinking at every moment in the back of my mind that Dad wasn't there to watch so "what was the point". This was entirely my fault, Dad has been watching me from the day that he left this world. A part of me at this point, and a smaller part still wonders if he left accidentally as the reports say. So many of the conversations between me and my mother regarding Dad end in her exclaiming that "Paul Barthel" killed him while negotiating a new business they were planning on starting. I think this is unlikely, but only due to occams razor and no concrete evidence like I would prefer. Sometimes when I am drunk I claim to be on a vengeance path to "Paul", but honestly I doubt I will ever consider following that avenue to its end. If I am wrong I am sure that Dad will give me a sign otherwise.

  

A friend I made during my late freshman and late sophomore year named John Simmers showed great support during a time of great need for me. He showed up to the funeral, played games with me while I was grieving and even encouraged me to find bigger and better things once he moved on from school (he was one year ahead of me in school). (I tried reaching out recently, he said that he is into fishing but has 3 kids so finding the time is difficult lol).  We lost touch for a while after he graduated, trying to start a band later but that idea fell apart for reasons beyond our control.

  

A year after John went into vocational school during my junior year I found myself without friends. I gravitated towards people I knew already (Zach Martin, Nick Detore, Steven Boepel, and a few others not worth mentioning primarily. I have since realized this group of friends to be my actual friend group from my freshman year and beyond, I ignored them due to a misunderstanding in a videogame from my freshman year, possibly before that even. I was lost... and eventually I found a purpose, a friend (Nick Detore) recommended I join "Chamber Singers" or concert choir to start. I was lucky, I tried out for concert choir and the teacher who I was auditioning for (Nathan Bankert) granted me a spot almost immediately, even going as far as recommending I join Chamber Singers. That was it, I was in... the first choir experience was one of the weirdest things I have experienced... a feeling of belonging and yet still foreign like a language you do not yet speak. I remember my mothers reaction when I told her I changed my schedule to include concert choir, and eventually chamber singers. I can't really remember a time where she was a happy for me as then, and I can understand why. Personally I believe this was one of the most important moments in my life. I could have chosen to sit back, take what comes to me and apply myself to a course of study that isn't requiring of my creative skills like math or physics. Instead I was led down a road of perpetual growth and replenishment of my will to live... I cannot think of anything to say except thank you Nick. I may have just become another statistic, or even worse... "you" have no idea what my mind was like during this time, and the fact that you recommended this and were there for me throughout means the universe to me... I am still searching for ways to repay you.

  

Shortly after my involvement in Chamber Singers started I began my interest in Musical, initially believing I would get a chorus part but being encouraged (by Mr. Bankert) to join as a lead role. I prepared it, sang it time and again... then eventually I got it, the role of Ubaldo Piangi in my local High School production of Phantom of the Opera. Rehearsals taught me a lot about accountability and responsibility. Eventually we made it to the production dates... believe it or not my grandpa came, along with both of my aunts on my Dad's side. It felt so bittersweet, all my life my grandpa and Dad had a bittersweet relationship... he was happy to see me but I feel it was in spite of my father's relationship to it all... but all I cared about during opening night was the opinion of my mother and aunt. I killed it, I was told I sang so loud during my part that they could hear me from the parking lot... not surprising considering how loud I am as a singer, especially when trying to reach higher notes.

  

I rode very highly on the aftershock of this event. My grades in my senior year were affected, people considered me "healed" but I was not in fact... not even fucking close.     

  

  

Unfortunately I am too drunk/tired to continue this incredibly heart wrenching memoir, I hope in the future to make it much worse (and more painful) for myself by way of relaying the past🙂

A Surprised Proposal and better times ahead...

  

I got the job... Willow valley contacted me last Thursday happily informing me of my new offer for the position of Maintenance 2 at Willow Valley Communities. I performed all the requisite drug testing and physical aptitude assessments. This may turn out to be one of the best moments of my life, I realized as I was walking to my car getting ready for a day of following through on my requirements to get the aforementioned job positions. A surreal time for someone who has bounced from a full time (assumedly life long) position at Clark to a shorter than short term at Americold and now ultimately (hopefully) to this. I pray with every fiber of my being that this job lasts longer than Americold, and I have a good feeling that it will be.

  

Today I accepted the invitation to be in my great friends wedding. Nicholas Detore and Lenea Rheil. Both of which I've known since high school, Nick very much longer. He is a difficult person to get a gauge on, by design I presume but nonetheless I am thankful that he though of me for a groomsman. I am slowly coming to terms with the fact that this is my life now, people I love and respect also loving and respecting my presence is something that I thought impossible before. I had assumed since high school that anyone who liked my presence was simply doing so because they were entertaining me or at least the idea of me, probably since my father passed away.

  

I am decidedly wrong about this, so it seems. Those around me genuinely seem to think I am worth the time of day, and love me... it feels good, less lonely than the world that I left behind. God loves me and wants good things for me, my friends enjoy my company and even express their grief for my absence when I am not present.  Perhaps I am worth the air that I breathe... maybe even better than that, God be praised. My friends told me that they support me through my personal choices, regarding my ever changing styles and also my crisis of self identity, in many more words than I have listed here.

  

Nick's wedding is supposed to be in May of next year according to the label that he put on my custom labeled bottle of vodka that I am drinking right now. I shall forever cherish this invitation as a reminder that I have friends that love and care about the person that I am, and also the person I want myself to be.

**A Sort of Brave Sorrow(eager to meet the future and improve myself)**

  

It's been quite a while since the last entry, or at least it feels like an age has passed. Before we begin with the present we must reflect on the past month or so. I have been enjoying learning the efficiencies of my position at Willow Valley Manor, Maintenance team quite a lot. It has (like many good new opportunities do) revealed a certain love for the quieter aspects of my life, additionally clarifying for me a few questions I have been having about myself as I assimilate unto my peers at WV (Willow Valley). I dejectedly love the service aspects of the position, and find myself constantly mystified for the lack of understanding between generations and ages of the past. Its almost like every 10 years or so a metaphorical extra measure of wall is build dividing those behind it from those who climb higher towards the light of the future. Simultaneously I find myself looking anxiously side to side at my peers as I slowly realize they all expect me to stay for longer than I feel comfortable accepting tenure. The previous fact is a double edged sword, providing I have a safe and stable place to build myself a staircase to the next achievement, while also condemning me to a indentured sort of requisition that I give "the best years of my life" to an organization I am clearly not in absolute love with.

  

I'm not certain how long my future is with willow valley, while I really do love them I wonder how long I will be happy at a position where I feel i'm not truly challenged on a day to day basis. I must train myself to remember that to remain stagnant in a job market such as the trades, at this point in my life is possibly the worst mistake in the current culture and job market. I must reaffirm myself that this is MY JOB and it is seriously important not to get the wrong kind of comfortable enough to be let go, and also maintain forward momentum perhaps with other aspects of my life.

  

This time of year is very difficult for my mother and I. My Mother and Father's wedding anniversary is 9/4/1993. I have noticed a pattern that during this time of the year (September - December) all of life's struggles tend to come to a head. Emotions of lost loved ones and either your love life or lack thereof. Most people get through this I've noted by getting a consistent group of people around you to spend time with and emotionally purge yourself of the previous years woes while hoping that the year to come is a better one. I mean to break this cycle in my life by finding a person to spend it with, and maybe we can make our own cycle. Hopefully soon.

  

I'm getting consistently better at playing the drums, I devote a lot of my excess energy and finances to the hobby and thoroughly enjoy the culture around and act of playing the instrument(s?). I have been thinking back recently on how I got back into playing them after we moved to a new neighborhood and was too anxious/stressed to play due to starting high school and being forced to move from our house on Wertztown Rd. When dad passed a family friend encouraged me to find something that I love doing, something that makes me feel like i'm flying above all of my problems and enjoying the moment, the here and now. His name was Andy Martin and he is on of the first examples of what could be considered a "father figure" when my dad passed. All said he only stayed around a few years after he broke up with my sister due to her moral toxicity during that time. The hobby of drumming continues to be on of the many ways I can and have pushed myself to be better not out of need, but of want... it proves difficult even now to find things I enjoy failing at.

  

I would love to play some dungeons a dragons, I will be devoting more time and effort into finding a group and playing the game I love in real life somehow. I constantly remind myself of how fun it is to play and direct its play, while also being very mentally exercising in often the greatest way. In a short amount of time I expect to find a group of at least 3 players to play the game I said I would begin almost a year ago by now.

  

I am increasingly growing tired and anxious all of the time, this is very worrying to me. I believe it is due to my increased alcohol consumption and perhaps my lack of cardiovascularly intensive work I have been doing since my departure from my very physical job at Clark. This paired with the extreme caffeine intake I have had in the past couple years along with many other contributing factors, could mean that I have an unhealthy heart. I seek to fix this by forcing myself to be more consistent with my diet and also to begin a cardio routine paired with my current weight lifting routine. I will play my energy level by ear but as soon as I grow used to this I will try and cut back on caffeine a bit also, but no promises yet seeing as it is in numeric things that I love to indulge in as well as the state of mind it brings me.

**A New Normal**

  

I am struggling, and I don't know why. Most of my major problems (at least short term) have been resolved. No fear of not having enough money to survive, no anxiety that those around me don't at least respect me, and lastly a reaffirming that the people I care about also care enough about me to not lie to me. So why then is it so difficult for me to just be content and live in this perfect prison I have created for myself? I feel selfish for even considering that my life is anything but perfect. By all accounts, recently my life has been nothing short of blessed. I will chalk this sudden onset of sadness to a change in the winds of the heart and hope that they get better with time like most things do. I have certainly been through harder things than this.

  

Bible study has been becoming tiresome. Recently (past ~4 months) I have been attending bible study, and I have been enjoying it. Mainly due to my lack of perspective on certain parts of the bible. It certainly helps to converse about complex problems with a group of people who care as much about it as I do. The only problem is that everyone who attends is 20+ years older than me. It makes me feel that I am making a mistake because of the lack of people in my age group who attend things like this. I'm not sure if i'm looking for a fix for this problem or if I enjoy being a sole representative of people my age to a group that has little context on the topic. Honestly I think it has something to do with the recent change from previously studying the ten commandments to reading a chapter a week out of a book called "Troubled Minds" which centers around a woman who dealt with the church ignoring her mothers mental illness, with a focus on how the church can help those with mental illnesses. I'm a fan of the format, I just feel that the book is not meant for me and being forced to endure older people trying to come to grips with the fact that they have been dealing with undiagnosed mental illness in those around them and themselves has really been weighing heavily on me. I'll stick it out for now, they have bought goodwill from listening to my lesson on the final thoughts of when we were going over the ten commandments. I just fear their reaction if I run out of patience and decide to stop attending. 

  

I feel that I am never going to find love. Everywhere I go I am surrounded by people older than I am. I suppose that is what happens when you are the better (mentally at least) of most of those around you. I avoided the lifelong anguish of the normal baby, student(x4), career I hate, family I abide, get old and die; progression of most people in my age group. It has created a schism of every kind between myself and people I likely love to get to know. I accidentally act older than I am, mentally dwarf most of my peers and thus get bored with interaction with a lot of them anyway. So since I lowed the amount of access I have to situations with those my age, I have inadvertently doomed myself to a loveless existence. Or at the very least I have delayed it to a point where I won't get to love Her for as long. I have even recently found signs of myself lowering my standards for what I classify as a good woman. Also my standards for who to interact with seem misaligned to most of my peers. I pray to find a Good Woman before I lose the best years of my youth. Being around so many elderly has made me value what I have in my youth. I currently am the best version of me that has ever been, and every time I begin to doubt that I am filled with both fear of what is both inevitable and absolutely necessary to the way I see my future being. I need to continue trying, and rolling the dice... maybe even risk giving those I wouldn't normally associate with a chance. Above everything, kindness is truly what makes a person worth associating with. You have to be a better person to build a better future. 

  

I fear becoming like the people who's values I hold in high esteem. My values, for a while now, have been shifting more and more "conservative" or so I have been told. As i have been aging and growing more as a person I have been realizing certain parts of what I have witnessed falsely to be a bad way of being. I used to think religion was silly, and objectively false and therefor bad. But now I think it is both the best way to ensure you and yours live as good a life as possible, as well as a great way to make yourself a better person, someone you enjoy waking up to. I used to think being unfit was fine, occasionally encouraged too. I now think that you owe it to yourself to see the pinnacle of what you can be physically, and it helps you get more time on the ride.

  

Today I found myself telling Dan at work about my father. In the moment I didn't really think anything of it, simple small talk right... but later I couldn't stop thinking about it. I remember him so well, idolize the man that he was but I haven't interacted with him in almost 10 years at this point in my life. I must realize he is part of the picture, not the whole of it. It is imperative I develop on an emotional level for my further life. I worry that I already am at that level but only now realizing other humans are incredibly dull and uninspiring. My father is a wellspring of what a man should do, but also things that he shouldn't. Adultery is an absolute evil, unless you have an incredibly uncommunicative partner, I think it is one of the worst things a person can do to someone they love. Racism isn't a good thing to teach children... I believe that even though it may serve a small purpose in keeping yourself safe, that ultimately it is a reflex taught to us by a person who simply fears what they do not understand fully. Being available to your family is something Dad wasn't very good at, when you began discussing difficult topics he would quicken to anger before sadness or even obstinacy. I think the reason for this is that he was somewhat autistic or has some sort of personality disorder, I love him no less even after learning of his hidden truths, but enhance all his good qualities subconsciously due to my love for his memory.

Forging A New Path

  

In this newfound stability I have come to the realization that I don't know where I am going. Moreover the love for the world is still there but in the afterglow of the recognition of my lack of place in it I am lost in the fear that a place will never be found. I want to be as great as people in my life think that I am, but when it comes down to it I really haven't achieved all that much compared to what I could have given my intellect and passions. The only remedy for this is drastic change. I must find a direction and stick to it, that is the only way you go far in life from what I have witnessed.

  

There are more painful questions I want to ask myself, suddenly I am fearing parts of my own mind. I am starting to reflexively block parts of my emotions, or could be that I am just starting to notice that I always have. A lack of remembrance of my past states of mind is what drove me to start keeping this journal I think in addition to general posterity for dates and goals.

  

I fear I will never find a woman and its due to my own boringness. I have hobbies, a wealth of knowledge, am an incredibly creative and expert storyteller but I lack a lot of necessary interpersonal skills that most people likely develop in college or in early employment. While I deeply understand and empathize with people, its difficult for me to find genuine emotional compassion for people. This leads me to a large amount of emotionally shallow but mostly intact relationships. Even looking back now at my recent interactions with close friends I found it difficult to remember times when I emotionally empathized with a person. In the moment I know how I should feel about things and react accordingly but most of the times I am caught off guard by my emotions it is when people are talking directly at me confrontationally. At the moment I'm not sure how to solve this, or if it even is an issue. Since I have nothing to compare to I am not sure how much/little empathy is normal (internally at least).

Early Hibernation

  

My mental health isn't great right now. Neither is my physical health really, I have all of the symptoms of a cold; running nose, sore throat and even a low grade fever. The growing pressure of my job aligned with the high standards I have placed on myself are leading to a bit of wear when it comes to my overall levels of inner conflict. My mind is slowed by a combination of drugs, stress and sickness and if I falter even a little bit I'm fucked. Miss a day of work and I fuck up a whole mess worth of scheduling, don't pay for this or you may not be able to pay your electric bill. It's getting to me, and I must find a way to cope. I think I need a new long term goal, something beneficial that will keep my mind off of everything while I do it. I'll think on it and make a list. 

  

My mother is a very challenging person to love. I love her more than anyone and that is quite difficult on me sometimes. She has less emotional understanding than most people, almost childlike in some ways but there's just something special about her and everyone else in her life sees it too. God saw fit to put us together, I saw the need to take care of her and now I'm having to deal with the repercussions of my decision. She is one of my major foundations in my emotional well being. So when she is unavailing in her efforts to have a small amount of patience or tact it makes me feel all the more worse. Prevailing wisdom would have me buckle down and provide to her demands, but doing so would only give her a new pedestal off of which to request more. It's happened before and its only human nature to expect what you do when you do, but I wish it was possible.

  

Next professional steps: It's become obvious that I need to further pursue a professional side business in order to continue the knowledge progression of my craft. I become excited by the fact that I get to work with electric at my full time job, a logical next step would be to think about if I want to spend my time doing that or take a chance by getting a history degree of some sort. There was a time when I was certain I was to become a theologian not too long ago. It's obvious to me now that there is more deciding to be done on this, for it is my future and next step.

  

I have been smoking THC again for about two months after quitting for nearly four to find a new job. I can't tell if I feel bad because of the drug or if I feel bad because I think I should feel bad about it. I'm certain I need to stop though, at least for a while. According to the internet it takes three to four weeks to feel the effects of a full detox. I am going to write a full journal entry about the experience throughout the four weeks. It will start when I have finished the last of my supply. Dependant on the outcome of the detox I will quit forever or only occasionally partake. This will make me a better person, so long as I find the skills to cope with the loss of a vice such as this.

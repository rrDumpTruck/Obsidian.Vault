# The Veins New Player Lore and Setting Start 

Welcome to the Veins

You see a meandering stream running out ahead of you, quick clear vapors with pieces of a metallic blue substance dart through its slightly viscous flow. This is The Juice, an incredibly valuable substance to the people who live in this place of undeath. Overhead emanating from a hole in the sky black as pitch is the vermillion visage of The Watcher, a looming manic expression hanging over the Veins like a planet. It’s almost spacelike landscape characterized by its fragmentation, an ivory Wall dividing it into four parts leading towards the center of the world. At the center lies The Convergence, proof of a time before this division. A column of cyan light conveys a mysterious energy deep within the earth drawing all who wish to enter to make pilgrimage to the Convergence. 

Things here don't change, not without a little special treatment at least. Unless you imbue something with The Juice; a substance retrieved from fissures that connect parts of the world to The Convergence, they are impermanent. Any object that remains unanointed recovers any harm that is done to it every day at sunrise. Structures, landscapes, people and even the food that they eat requires anointment and or imbuement with differently refined levels of the Juice. Memories never fade and people age very slowly while under the effect of the Juice. 

Last week marks the one hundred and fiftieth year since The Convergence took place. Not much is known about what came before but shortly after a group of Forty Four Saints arrived to the veins, eleven went in each direction and tried their best to make a kingdom of their own. Decades of war followed; Eventually it boiled down to one per kingdom. Four Kingdoms each ruled by one. After each kingdom was declared, each founder sacrificed their mortal forms to create lesser versions of immortal life, in the form of the various races of Tiefling and other unholy races of people.  

Now the land grows crowded leading people beyond the old laylines, leading Pathfinders out into the dark for land to seep their industry into. In an industrial age of many mysteries how long will the Watcher grant you reprieve? The Formless guide all whom seek them, however vain or uncompromising the wish or sacrifice.

The Four Kingdoms

In the North, the Kingdom of the Howling Plateau is proclaimed the first by a cruel, hate-filled tyrant calling themselves the Harvester. Being quite industrious he founded the city of Opportunity on top of a very large fissure.  It becomes the home of a large majority of adventurers that are called the Vein Hunters, responsible for the gathering of the Juice from nearby fissures and locating new ones. 

In the East, the Kingdom of Elysia is presented by an immeasurably wise mage naming himself the Listener. His realm was one of peace and proliferation of love and debauchery, founding a city of heathens and thusly named the Profligate City.   

In the South, the Kingdom of The Glistering Highlands is founded under the control of a sulking coward calling themselves the Limper, a violent, vengeful and greedy man. Eventually he founded the largest city in the world, the underground city of Galolir, home of the only Maleorite mine in the world.   

In the West, the territory of the Stygian Forest is claimed by a ruthless lustful woman calling herself the Sleeper. To rule her realm for her she creates the first Druids, their purpose is to keep the immense oaken forest tame and flourishing so that she may keep the world from turning on its denizens. The history of this place lead to its now reputation for being the home of the Pathfinders, an organization known for its teachings of wayfinding and their representation in providing discrete services for anyone needing to pass through The Wall that was created by The Convergence in means other than the four main staircases at its center.

Woes of War

After nearly fifty years of peace in the year one hundred and twenty two Elysia decides to try and conquer the Stygian Forest, leading to their defeat two years later at the hands of an ecosystem destroying device that was secretly placed inside of the Profligate City. This leads to years of devastation and unspeakable horror for the entire population of Elysia, after this event people refer to this place as “the Ashen Wastes” or “the Wastes”.

A Fall From Grace

Over twenty years later in the year one hundred and forty five scouts at the center of The Convergence spotted a strange looking person standing in the deepest parts of the fracture wearing an even stranger amulet. This is the appearance of the first Herald. The Herald is a person known to announce the end of the world according to the Listener. The man found in The Convergence was pronounced dead at the first sunrise when The Watcher opened their eyes.

A Fall From Opportunity

  

Just earlier this year in the fissure under the city of Opportunity another Heralds appearance was witnessed. People representing the ruler of the city Saint Damius forbade anyone from outside witnessing the event or questioning its circumstances. Though many have tried it seems he can’t be found. The event is called "The Arrival of the Stranger"

Game Start Choices

Please choose one of the following three starting scenarios you would prefer to start as, as well as what class you might play and let me know in the new player questionnaire. But read the lore/rules first. 

  

(1)Fortune Finders

  

You and your party are Vein Hunters that find their home in the city of Opportunity in the Howling Plateau. You have just accepted a job to scout and optionally harvest a newly formed local fissure and to report any findings to a local Fleshcrafter known as “Aorta''. You haven't met your contractor but from what you have heard this may just be an introductory job, who knows what future Opportunity might bring. 

  

note: A Pathfinder (a person who is studied in the excavating and locating of veins) is required for this campaign start, you can choose to play one or hire an NPC. The Role uses your main skill's bonus for all roles and has a separate progression from your class level(s), your pathfinder level is reliant on how much your power is used.

  
  

(2)Opportune Investigation

  

You and your party members run an investigation agency in the city of Opportunity. Recently you have accepted a contract from Lorelei, the wife of a local blacksmith who has gone missing. You find it quite interesting because the blacksmiths’ shop is just a block and a half away from where the second Herald was found earlier this year. Your first questioning of Lorelei is in the morning and you won’t want to miss it. 

  

note: The investigation agency requires a monthly upkeep cost for various parts of your business, this affords a place to sleep and food for all employees of the agency.

  

(3)Courier Service

  

An 18 karat run of bad luck, you and your associates woke up from an extended nap alongside a main road leading to Opportunity. Your party is a caravan turned courier service under the employment of the Cobalt Corporation based out of Galolir, your travels have taken you around the world and throughout the Wall many times already but your organization is still only a few months old. Things are lower than they have ever been but you are headed into Opportunity next so things just may still turn out in your favor. 

  

note: Someone will have to be the leader of the caravan, they will be responsible for reporting to their superiors at the Cobalt Corporation at some point in the future...

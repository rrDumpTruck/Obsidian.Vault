<span style="color:#00b0f0">Dark</span> (Netflix tv show) a study on dramatic irony: 

---

<span style="color:#7030a0">Fargo</span>: Talking about the importance of repetitive dialogue in tv and movies. 

Fargo season 5 is scheduled to air late 2023. Maybe wait until the season is finished to make a 5 season vid. Alternatively make a video for just the first season as it is the most thematically stable. 

Limited audience reach, unless it becomes popular again or I get really creative.

<span style="color:#7030a0">Classical Music</span>: Understanding the psychology and effects of music with a focus on classical and baroque styled works.** Work on developing an understanding of what causes us to react certain ways to different types of music. 

This is good in principle but may lack a popular audience, maybe a good one for when an audience is already formed.

**<span style="color:#ff0000">PKA</span>**: Talking about the history and impact (personal or otherwise)

This may be bad timing for this style of video. Some may say I am eliciting “hype” off of the recent boxing event starring Wingsofredemtion and Boogie2988. Also a advertiser hazard, may be a much later project, probably more interesting too. Best to put as much time between my video and the [down the rabbit hole](https://youtu.be/LNHbm7GBHwg "https://youtu.be/LNHbm7GBHwg") about Wings

<span style="color:#00b050">Bladerunner</span> (2049 AND OG): Talking about what makes us human, and/or how empathy is purposefully elicited in film. 

I am pretty sure I watched a video about this, just need to check. 

Pretty sure that the videos (at least the popular ones) are at least 5 years old, or cover a different subtext such as [“A hero who doesn’t matter”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JP3Rv-x3uI&t=210s "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JP3Rv-x3uI&t=210s"), or the different science fiction elements of the movie like the Voight-Kampff test or the cells within cells interlinked empathy tests and what they mean. Definitely a viable audience due to the cult following of the genre (both synth sci fi and dark drama a la cyberpunk and Watchmen).

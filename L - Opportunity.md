Located in the hilly region central to the Howling plateau, to the south of a monumental shard of obsidian protruding from the ground lies the city of Opportunity. Dense arteries of veins intersect her many gates and walls. Casting a leering blue hue on the severe angles of the scrollwork and architecture adorning every piece of it. It tells a story of those who founded the city, some of its major familial sigils are on each gate of the metropolis. A mountain with three raised peaks(Church, government, commerce/culture.) a city layered in the lands uneven spots. Surrounding the many buildings of the uneven and tiered city is a wall of opaque black glass, with areas of older wrought iron and black stone. 

Its web of roads leading to and from many gates leads to every door in the city, up endless ramps and stairs you are brought to Opportunities grand concourse. A gigantic main street surrounding a black spear like shard of obsidian nearly 20 feet tall suspended in a gravitational field of some sort. It leads to each of the cities many districts and up to the keep far above through a series of large slabs of stone stacked on one another, some extending up and over the sea seemingly supported by nothing. 

At the Top of the Mountain: Lies a burnt keep rising from the foundational stone deep down. Made from a tarnished grey stone its scale makes you wonder how big of a person it was meant for. 

1. <span style="color:#00b0f0">Damius' Forum</span> *In middle of Hill*: A place for worship, guidance and learning. There are a few minor religious establishments on the hilltop but the majority of ground is covered by the house of the Wind and Water, a knights academy that teaches Vein hunters and is trying to learn how to teach pathfinders.

4. <span style="color:#7030a0">Storming Ridge</span> "Logistics Co. Sponsored Depot": Undercity of a sort on the outermost part of the city just inside near a train station and large offloading cranes. Train is being assembled in a large yard made *specifically* for interchanging to unbuilt lines. 
5. <span style="color:#00b0f0">The Narrows</span>: Back alley brawling and more extremism for worshiping Damocan. Also low level bars, businesses among a growing too large amount of homes.

7. <span style="color:#ff0000">The Consortium</span>: The consortium is what they call the shadowed organization who has eyes all over opportunity. Everything from study of dark magic to past assassination attempts against the Sleeper shortly after the fall of Elysia. 

The consortium maintains a legitimate business in Opportunity where they run a kind of magic shop, book store and alchemist. The shop is ran by one Jedediah Narrowfeather, father of a local political dissonant, Drake Narrowfeather who leads the peoples Republic of Opportunity. 

*secret to all but Badmeis* In recent times the organization has taken contracts both far and wide, even accepted some special help from some professors at the institute. Of note recently a special secret contract has been rumored to find more information on the Herald.
1. <span style="color:#00b0f0">Upper End</span>: Housing district for the upper class and well inherited.
2. <span style="color:#00b0f0">Lower End</span>: The road leading from the Grand Concourse spirals down into the mountain that the keep is settled upon. Hinting at a city yet unseen. 
Further down you find that road leads to many different type of underground settlement. A cavernous basin of blue Juice with a incising road leading to hovels, homes and even some prouder buildings on the spires of earth left behind. Far below a Sapphire beam of light shines from the deepest depths of the cavern up and into somewhere above.

# The Veins New Player Onboarding Program (TV-N'POP)

First Rule

If someone tells you to stop or make reasonable requests during RP, due to them feeling uncomfortable, you have to.

---

Game time

Up for argument (Friday or Saturday nights weekly/biweekly)

---

Game length/frequency

I hope to play weekly 4 hour sessions unless that conflicts with peoples schedules. 

---

Game system

5e DND unless some other system works better somehow in future. Due to the Goal-Based experience system less combat than necessary will be involved than in a traditional campaign. Combat will be brutal and consequential, unspeakable threats linger, waiting to be unexpected. 

---

Game location

Over discord (mic required/cam optional), and played on Foundry VTT

---

Application

Please Read the Rules and Lore Documents before submitting an application.

Goal-Based Experience

No more encounter based XP - if you fight something for no reason, you’re not rewarded for it.

  

Goal and Quest based XP - a goal is a player-set objective, a quest is an NPC or Faction-set objective. Goals apply to individual PCs, Quests apply to the entire group.

  

Each character has three Goal Slots, which can be filled with a Goal to be achieved. Such as; [ ] = DM’s thoughts on difficulty and reward

- “I want to find out a secret of the world”[Large range of difficulty, rewarded off of how rare the information is that you find]
    
- “I want to make friends or get closer to (insert party member here)”[Difficulty based on how hard the person makes it to be friends with]
    
- “I want to steal something of value and sell it for profit”[Difficulty ranges on how much of a risk it brings the character]
    
- “I want to save someone from the brink of death” [Hard-Deadly if done in combat Easy-Medium if done in a brothel]
    
- “Escape from the castle” [Difficulty subject to difficulty of escape]
    
- “Enter the dark woods” [Easy-Medium]
    
- “Discover who The Watcher is” [Redacted]
    

  

The GM assesses the difficulty of the goal, and assigns it a category; “Easy, Medium, Hard, Deadly” based on narrative likelihood they’ll succeed, obstacles in the way, etc.

  

Category of the goal is equated to an XP value. Achieving the goal means getting the XP.

  

GOALS: XP values are Encounter Difficulty*3 in XP value

QUESTS: XP values are Encounter Difficulty*4 in XP value

[Encounter Calculator](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/building-combat-encounters#CombatEncounterDifficulty)

Same goes for Quests; the difficulty is similarly adjusted and the source is external.

- “Go to the Tower of Hell’s Fury and Kick the Wizard in his Butt”
    

  

Attempting to accomplish a goal or quest and failing means no XP, too bad, you failed. This is not an XP for a failing model. However, taking a meaningful risk in pursuit of the goal (usually a roll or some investment is involved) nets a player 50 x their level in XP for ongoing pursuit. 

  

Goals can be changed at the start of the session or abandoned at any time.

  

If a goal is resolved during a session, you don’t just get to write a new one. Meaning there is a maximum of 3 goals completed of any difficulty/type per session. 

  

THE POINT: the players now have a method for telling ME what they want in the game and mechanically invest the players via their characters in the game itself

  

Occasionally: The DM will provide discretionary difficulty hints (when a task seems easy and in fact would be very challenging or impossible, I will never tell you a goal is a secret difficulty additionally letting you know when a goal has gotten easier, but will usually respond to the question in a one sentence answer. 

The DM may occasionally provide bonus XP to certain goals per session or even at time of completion. 

---

Hold Action Multiattack

When you hold your action for an attack, you can take all the attacks you’re normally entitled to.

---

Bonus Action Spells

So long as only a single spell slot is used you may cast a spell with both your action and your bonus action.

---

Hold Action Spell

A spell may be cast as a held action, if the use case specified in the held action does not happen… the character loses the spell slot in question but may choose to have the spell not go off. 

---

Non-playable Races

No restrictions unless I find something that doesn't really work with the world's logic or lore. Generally people have a darker theme in the world of the Veins due to its founders being more or less demonic. You may choose to play a character that is less fitting to the setting but it will be noticeable in crowds, dialogue and various other interactions in the game.

Most races are fine, if there is a certain race that may not show up in my setting, ask me, I'm sure we can homebrew something. 

  

Any spell or class feature can be temporarily or permanently banned if a lore reason can be specified or levied against the sanctity of the world’s realism. I will use this incredibly sparingly but it is necessary for the game to remain relevant at later levels. 

---

Encumbrance

“Gold” weighs nothing, I don't care, go nuts. If its reasonable I will probably let you carry over your weight, unless you are carrying another player or npc.

---

PVP

Try not to do it, it makes everything a lot less fun due to D&D not being balanced for it. 

---

Gameplay Based Feedback 

Every few sessions I will poll the players (formally or otherwise) about how they are liking the games. Making sure everyone is having a good time is my session goal. 

  
  
  

If after reading the Lore, Rules and background information on the games systems and setting you think this game would interest you please continue to the player application and use the word potato as the answer to your first question. 

  

Thanks.
